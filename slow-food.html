      <p><dfn>Slow Food</dfn> is a worldwide movement that <q>envisions a world in which all people can access and enjoy food that is good for them, good for those who grow it, and good for the planet,</q> according to the organization Slow Food International.</p>
      <p>It is called slow food at a time when fast-food outlets are multiplying, an eco-gastronomic movement is developing, the aim of which is to counter junk food and anything that could harm health.</p>

        <h2>Slow Food (Organization)</h2>
        <p>Slow Food is an organization that promotes local food and traditional cooking. It was founded by Carlo Petrini in Italy in 1986 and has since spread worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Slow Cooking</h2>
        <p><dfn>Slow cooking</dfn> is a way of cooking food slowly on low heat – 140 degrees Celsius or lower – over a long period of time (most commonly four-to-eight hours), typically in a rounded, lidded pot (<strong>slow cooker</strong>) on the stovetop or in the oven.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Slow cooking is a culinary method that cooks food gently on low heat for an extended period, often in a lidded pot or slow cooker, to tenderize tougher cuts of meat, infuse deep flavors, and retain moisture, resulting in moist, flavorful, and often nutritious dishes with minimal preparation. It is a <q>set it and forget it</q> style of cooking, perfect for busy individuals, as the food can cook unattended for several hours.</p>
          <p><strong>Key Characteristics</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Low, slow heat</strong> The defining feature is the prolonged cooking at a low temperature (typically well below 140°C or 285°F).</li>
            <li><strong>Moist, enclosed environment</strong> The use of a tightly-fitting lid traps steam, which condenses and drips back into the pot, self-basting the ingredients in their own juices.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenderization</strong> The slow, gentle heat breaks down tough connective tissues in cuts of meat, making them incredibly tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Flavor infusion</strong> The long cooking time allows flavors to develop and meld, creating deep, complex tastes.</li>
            <li><strong>Nutrient retention</strong> This method helps retain more nutrients compared to faster cooking methods like boiling or frying.</li>
            <li><strong>Hands-off cooking</strong> Once the ingredients are prepared and placed in the slow cooker, they can cook for several hours with little supervision</li>
          </ul>

          <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>AI Overview</cite>, by Google)</p>
          <p>For beginner slow cooking, start with recipes for tougher cuts of meat, layer ingredients with root vegetables at the bottom, and avoid overfilling the pot. Brown meats before adding them for better flavor and to prevent dryness. Use less liquid than traditional recipes, add dairy products like milk or cheese at the very end to prevent curdling, and avoid lifting the lid to maintain heat and ensure even cooking.</p>

          <p>Low-temperature cooking is a cooking technique that uses temperatures in the range of about 60 to 90 °C (140 to 194 °F) for a prolonged time to cook food. Low-temperature cooking methods include <i>sous vide</i> cooking, <a href="#slow-cooking">slow cooking</a> using a slow cooker, cooking in a normal oven which has a minimal setting of about 70 °C (158 °F), and using a combi steamer providing exact temperature control. The traditional cooking pit also cooks food at low temperature.</p>
