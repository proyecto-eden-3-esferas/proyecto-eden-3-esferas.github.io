      <h1>Black Boxex in Artificial Intellligence</h1>
      <p>An <dfn>AI black box</dfn> is an AI systems with internal workings that are invisible to the user. You can feed them input and get output, but you cannot examine the system&apos;s code or the logic that produced the output.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="machine_learning.html">machine learning</a> system three components can be identified: an algorithm or a set of algorithms, training data and a model. Any of the three components of a machine-learning system can be hidden, or in a black box. As is often the case, the algorithm is publicly known, which makes putting it in a black box less effective. So to protect their intellectual property, AI developers often put the model in a black box. Another approach software developers take is to obscure the data used to train the model â€“ in other words, put the training data in a black box.</p>

      <p>The opposite of a black box is sometimes referred to as a glass box. An AI <dfn>glass box</dfn> is a system whose algorithms, training data and model are all available for anyone to see. But researchers sometimes characterize aspects of even these as black box.</p>
      <p>That&apos;s because researchers don&apos;t fully understand how machine-learning algorithms, particularly deep-learning algorithms, operate. The field of explainable AI is working to develop algorithms that, while not necessarily glass box, can be better understood by humans.</p>
