      <h1>Cases: Morphemes Denoting Function</h1>
      <p>Case is usually an inflectional (usually realized as endings) feature of nouns and, depending on language, other parts of speech (pronouns, adjectives, determiners, numerals, verbs) that mark agreement with nouns.</p>
      <!--
      <p>Case can also be a lexical feature of adpositions and describe the case meaning that the adposition contributes to the nominal in which it appears. (This usage of the feature is typical for languages that do not have case morphology on nouns. For languages that have both adpositions and morphological case, the traditional set of cases is determined by the nominal forms and it does not cover adpositional meanings.) In some non-UD tagsets, case of adpositions is used as a valency feature (saying that the adposition requires its nominal argument to be in that morphological case); however, annotating adposition valency case in UD treebanks would be superfluous because the same case feature can be found at the nominal to which the adposition belongs.</p>
      -->
      <p>Case helps specify the role of the noun phrase in the sentence, especially in free-word-order languages. For example, the nominative and accusative cases often distinguish subject and object of the verb, while in fixed-word-order languages these functions would be distinguished merely by the positions of the nouns in the sentence.</p>
      <p>Here on the level of morphosyntactic features we are dealing with case expressed morphologically, i.e. by bound morphemes (<dfn>affixes</dfn>). Note that on a higher level case can be understood more broadly as the role, and it can be also expressed by adding an <dfn>adposition</dfn> (that is, either a preposition or a postposition) to the noun. What is expressed by affixes in one language can be expressed using adpositions (prepositions or postpositions) in another language.</p>

        <h2>Indo-European Cases</h2>
        <p>Historical Indo-European had eight cases, which are preserved in Sanskrit and to a lesser extent in Baltic and Slavic languages.</p>
        <p>The most common cases in European languages are nominative (subject), accusative (object), dative (personal object) and genitive (possession). German and Greek have these four cases.</p>
        <p>Indo-European cases are as follows, with examples either of the English case or of the English syntactic alternative to case:</p>
