      <h1>Biomes</h1>
      <p><strong class='firstterm'>Biomes</strong> are regions of the world with a similar climate â€“ the amount of rainfall and temperature. The climate affects which plants will grow and in turn which animals (and other living things) can make their living there. Every community of living things is adapted for survival in the biome in which it lives. A <strong class='firstterm'>community</strong> is many different kinds of organisms living together in one habitat. The type of soil affects a biome to a lesser degree, but still plays a role.</p>
      <p>There are both terrestrial biomes (land) and aquatic biomes (water) on Earth. Terrestrial biomes make up less than 30% of the Earth&apos;s surface. The rest are aquatic biomes.</p>

      <p>Biomes may span more than one continent. A biome encompasses multiple ecosystems within its boundaries. It can also comprise a variety of habitats.</p>

      <p>A biota is the total collection of organisms of a geographic region or a time period, from local geographic scales and instantaneous temporal scales all the way up to whole-planet and whole-timescale spatiotemporal scales. The biotas of the Earth make up the biosphere.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Native plant species originated and co-evolved in communities with other organisms in fourteen identified biomes around the world. Biomes are composed of groups of ecosystems with distinct vegetation types and climate patterns. They are typically named for the dominant vegetation type, such as a forest or grassland.</p>
        <p>With an understanding of plant biology, hardiness, and interactions with soils and climate, native species from different biomes can be successfully grown in landscapes and gardens around the world.</p>
        <p>Individual ecosystems within larger biomes are characterized by the naturally occurring communities of native plants and animals and the distinct soil types, land forms, and climate of the area.</p>
