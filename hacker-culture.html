      <h1>Hacker Culture</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The roots of open source go back to computer science practices in the 1960s in academia and early computer user groups. Computer programmers frequently and informally shared code that they had written (<q>hacked</q>), quickly recycling and freely modifying code that solved common technical problems. Several different technical cultures began to develop, in parallel and semi-independently, practices similar to modern open-source development—though without today&apos;s apparatus of common licenses and fast communication via the Internet.</p>
        <p>The practice of sharing code was most effective and consistent among developers of the UNIX operating system, which was central to UNIX&apos;s early success. UNIX was first developed about 1970 at the Bell Laboratories subsidiary of the AT&amp;T Corporation for use on the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 minicomputer. As UNIX was adapted for various computer hardware systems, new variants of the operating system were developed. By the time that AT&amp;T and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (a proponent of the UNIX variant developed at the University of California, Berkeley), finally decided to commercialize UNIX in 1987, a large segment of computer manufacturers and software developers decided that they needed an <q>open</q> system and formed the Open Software Foundation. This set off the so-called <q>UNIX wars</q> among minicomputer enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>The shift from informal sharing of code to explicit open-source practice actually began a few years earlier with Richard M. Stallman. Stallman, a charismatic programmer who had thrived in the computer science environment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), collided with the increasing commercialization of software in the early 1980s. With more companies blocking access to their source codes, Stallman felt frustrated in his efforts to fix and improve these codes, so he decided that proprietary software must be publicly opposed. In 1984 he resigned from MIT to found the GNU Project, with the goal of developing a completely free UNIX-like operating system. (GNU is a recursive acronym for <q>GNU&apos;s not UNIX.</q>) In 1985 he delivered the <cite>GNU Manifesto</cite> outlining his program of free software development, formed the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and launched what he called the free software movement.</p>
        <p>Stallman may have been the first to propose a label for what many computer programmers had been doing all along, but the term free software was never universally accepted among programmers. Before Stallman issued the <cite>GNU Manifesto</cite>, few programmers had any sense of being members of a social movement, and, once that sense developed, Stallman&apos;s label carried too much ideological freight for many of them.</p>
        <p>In pursuit of his ends, Stallman wrote the General Public License (GPL), a document attached to computer code that would legally require anyone distributing that code to make available any of their modifications and distributed works (a property Stallman called <q>copyleft</q>). In effect, he sought to codify the hacker ethos. By the end of the century, the GPL was the license of choice for approximately half of all open-source projects. The other half was divided among non-copyleft licenses, notably the MIT license, and various licenses based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), developed in the 1970s at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>After 1987 the availability of Intel Corporation&apos;s 32-bit 386 microprocessor meant that inexpensive personal computers (PCs) had sufficient power to run UNIX—in fact, the SCO Group released the first version of UNIX to run on the 386 that year. Some programmers who had been key players in the development of the BSD variant of UNIX founded a project called 386BSD to port that variant to PCs. The Free Software Foundation&apos;s HURD operating system project also refocused on the 386-based PC. But both projects lagged at a critical time, 386BSD because of a lawsuit and HURD because of unrealistic design goals.</p>
