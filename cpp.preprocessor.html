      <h1>The C/C++ Preprocessor</h1>
      <p>The C preprocessor, often known as cpp, is a macro processor that is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program before compilation. It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define macros, which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.</p>
      <p>The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C and C++.</p>

      <h2>Calling the GNU C/C++ Preprocessor Alone (<code>cpp</code> in GCC)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/</cite>)</p>

      <p>Most often when you use the C preprocessor you do not have to invoke it explicitly: the C compiler does so automatically. However, the preprocessor is sometimes useful on its own. You can invoke the preprocessor either with the <code>cpp</code> command, or via <code>gcc -E</code>. In GCC, the preprocessor is actually integrated with the compiler rather than a separate program, and both of these commands invoke GCC and tell it to stop after the preprocessing phase.</p>
      <p>The cpp options listed below are also accepted by <code>gcc</code> and have the same meaning. Likewise the cpp command accepts all the usual gcc driver options, although those pertaining to compilation phases after preprocessing are ignored.</p>
      <p>Only options specific to preprocessing behavior are documented here. Refer to the GCC manual for full documentation of other driver options.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank lines and all comments with spaces. Long runs of blank lines are discarded.</p>
      <p>The ISO standard specifies that it is implementation defined whether a preprocessor preserves whitespace between tokens, or replaces it with e.g. a single space. In GNU CPP, whitespace between tokens is collapsed to become a single space, with the exception that the first token on a non-directive line is preceded with sufficient spaces that it appears in the same column in the preprocessed output that it appeared in the original source file.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>The cpp command expects two file names as arguments, <var>infile</var> and <var>outfile</var>. The preprocessor reads infile together with any other files it specifies with <code>#include</code>. All the output generated by the combined input files is written in outfile.</p>
      <p>Either infile or outfile may be <code>-</code>, which as <var>infile</var> means to read from standard input and as <code>outfile</code> means to write to standard output. If either file is omitted, it means the same as if <code>-</code> had been specified for that file. You can also use the <code>-o <var>outfile</var></code> option to specify the output file.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in <code>=</code>, all options which take an argument may have that argument appear either immediately after the option, or with a space between option and argument: <code>-Ifoo</code> and <code>-I foo</code> have the same effect.</p>
      <p>Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options may not be grouped: <code>-dM</code> is very different from <code>-d -M</code>.</p>

      <hr/>

      <dl>

        <dt><code>-D <var>name</var></code></dt>
        <dd>Predefine name as a macro, with definition <code>1</code>.</dd>

        <dt><code>-D <var>name</var>=<var>definition</var></code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>The contents of definition are tokenized and processed as if they appeared during translation phase three in a <code>#define</code> directive. In particular, the definition is truncated by embedded newline characters.</p>
          <p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shell&apos;s quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.</p>
          <p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should quote the option. With sh and csh, <code>-D&apos;name(argsâ€¦)=definition&apos;</code> works.</p>
          <p><code>-D</code> and <code>-U</code> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line. All -imacros file and -include file options are processed after all <code>-D</code> and <code>-U</code> options.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>-U <var>name</var></code></dt>
        <dd>Cancel any previous definition of <var>name</var>, either built in or provided with a <code>-D</code> option.</dd>

        <dt><code>-M</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable for make describing the dependencies of the main source file. The preprocessor outputs one make rule containing the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files, including those coming from -include or -imacros command-line options.</p>
          <p>Unless specified explicitly (with -MT or -MQ), the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory parts removed. If there are many included files then the rule is split into several lines using &apos;\&apos;-newline. The rule has no commands.</p>
          <p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor&apos;s debug output, such as -dM. To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with -MF, or use an environment variable like DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT (see Environment Variables). Debug output is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>
          <p>Passing -M to the driver implies -E, and suppresses warnings with an implicit -w.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><code>-MM</code></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Like -M but do not mention header files that are found in system header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.</p>
          <p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an &apos;#include&apos; directive does not in itself determine whether that header appears in -MM dependency output.</p>
