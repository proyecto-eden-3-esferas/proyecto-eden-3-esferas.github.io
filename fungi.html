      <h1>Fungi</h1>
      <p>Abundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment.</p>
      <p>Fungi have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases, and insect pests.</p>
      <p>Many species of fungi produce bioactive compounds called <strong>mycotoxins</strong>, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals, including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies.</p>
      <p>Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Although inaccurate, the common misconception that fungi are <a target="_blank" href="plants.html">plants</a> persists among the general public due to their historical classification, as well as several similarities. Like plants, fungi often grow in <a target="_blank" href="soil.html">soil</a> and, in the case of mushrooms, form conspicuous fruit bodies, which sometimes resemble plants such as mosses.</p>
        <p>The fungi are now considered a separate kingdom, distinct from both plants and animals, from which they appear to have diverged around one billion years ago (around the start of the Neoproterozoic Era). Some morphological, biochemical, and genetic features are shared with other organisms, while others are unique to the fungi, clearly separating them from the other kingdoms:</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Shared features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>With other eukaryotes: Fungal cells contain membrane-bound nuclei with chromosomes that contain DNA with noncoding regions called <dfn>introns</dfn> and coding regions called <dfn>exons</dfn>. Fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria, sterol-containing membranes, and ribosomes of the 80S type. They have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds, including sugar alcohols (e.g., mannitol), disaccharides, (e.g., trehalose), and polysaccharides (e.g., glycogen, which is also found in animals).</li>
          <li>With animals: Fungi lack chloroplasts and are heterotrophic organisms and so require preformed organic compounds as energy sources.</li>
          <li>With plants: Fungi have a cell wall and vacuoles. They reproduce by both sexual and asexual means, and like basal plant groups (such as ferns and mosses) produce spores. Similar to mosses and algae, fungi typically have haploid nuclei.</li>
          <li>With euglenoids and bacteria: Higher fungi, euglenoids, and some bacteria produce the amino acid L-lysine in specific biosynthesis steps, called the α-aminoadipate pathway.</li>
          <li>In common with some plant and animal species, more than one hundred fungal species display bioluminescence.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside>
          <p>One of the unique attributes of fungi is the ability to produce melanin, a pigment composed of polymers made from the amino acid tyrosine, which shields them from UV radiation, pH stress, and exposure to heavy metals. Melanin also weakens the effectiveness of antifungal medications and helps fungi fend off the aggressive mammalian immune system.  Through a process called radiosynthesis, fungi even use their melanin to convert radiation into chemical energy they can use.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Unique features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The cells of most fungi grow as tubular, elongated, and thread-like (filamentous) structures called <dfn>hyphae</dfn>, which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips. Each tip contains a set of aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the <strong>Spitzenkörper</strong>. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells.</li>
          <li>Some species grow as unicellular yeasts that do not form hyphae and reproduce by budding or fission. Dimorphic fungi can switch between a yeast phase and a hyphal phase in response to environmental conditions.</li>
          <li>The fungal cell wall is made of a chitin-glucan complex; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall. Unlike those of plants and oomycetes, fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most fungi lack an efficient system for the long-distance transport of water and nutrients, such as the xylem and phloem in many plants. To overcome this limitation, some fungi, such as <i lang="la">Armillaria</i>, form rhizomorphs, which resemble and perform functions similar to the roots of plants. As eukaryotes, fungi possess a biosynthetic pathway for producing terpenes that uses mevalonic acid and pyrophosphate as chemical building blocks. Plants and some other organisms have an additional terpene biosynthesis pathway in their chloroplasts, a structure that fungi and animals do not have. Fungi produce several secondary metabolites that are similar or identical in structure to those made by plants. Many of the plant and fungal enzymes that make these compounds differ from each other in sequence and other characteristics, which indicates separate origins and convergent evolution of these enzymes in the fungi and plants.</p>

      <section id="growth">
        <h2>Growth</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From Wikipedia)</p>
        <p>The growth of fungi as hyphae on or in solid substrates or as single cells in aquatic environments is adapted for the efficient extraction of nutrients, because these growth forms have high surface area to volume ratios. Hyphae are specifically adapted for growth on solid surfaces, and to invade substrates and tissues. They can exert large penetrative mechanical forces; for example, many plant pathogens, including <i lang="la">Magnaporthe grisea</i>, form a structure called an <dfn>appressorium</dfn> that evolved to puncture plant tissues. The pressure generated by the appressorium, directed against the plant epidermis, can exceed 8 megapascals (1,200 psi). The filamentous fungus <i lang="la">Paecilomyces lilacinus</i> uses a similar structure to penetrate the eggs of nematodes.</p>
        <p>The mechanical pressure exerted by the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations such as these are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) as in the case of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.</p>

      <section id="physiology">
        <h2>Physiology</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From Wikipedia)</p>
        <p>Fungi are traditionally considered heterotrophs, organisms that rely solely on carbon fixed by other organisms for metabolism. Fungi have evolved a high degree of metabolic versatility that allows them to use a diverse range of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as nitrate, ammonia, acetate, or ethanol. In some species the pigment melanin may play a role in extracting energy from ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation. This form of <q>radiotrophic</q> growth has been described for only a few species, the effects on growth rates are small, and the underlying biophysical and biochemical processes are not well known. This process might bear similarity to CO<sub>2</sub> fixation via visible light, but instead uses ionizing radiation as a source of energy.</p>
