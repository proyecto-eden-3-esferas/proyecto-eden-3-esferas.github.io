      <h1>Mapping Texts: Computational Text Analysis for the Social Sciences</h1>
      <p>Metaphors orient us. Many guides to text analysis use the mining metaphor. When <strong>mining</strong>, we search for a valuable vein to extract from valueless gangue. Information retrieval scholars pioneered computer-assisted text analysis by confronting the problem of (as you might guess) retrieving the most relevant documents from ever-growing databases. Parts of the documents were less helpful for completing this task. This was especially true when computational resources were minimal. Mining was an apt metaphor.</p>
      <p><strong>Mapping</strong>, by contrast, is not about extraction. It is about <strong>reduction</strong> to aid interpretation. When mapping texts, we simplify their information, but always for particular uses. Many useful cartographies are based on the same territory: road maps, contour maps, political maps, to name a few. Wrangling, pruning, stopping, and transforming text all involve a decision informed by a particular goal. To put it plainly: <em>there is not a sole kernel of truth to be extracted, but rather a range of empirical patterns</em>. There is an unfinished quality to text analysisâ€”perhaps all science. Repeating, then, is a cornerstone of this [section]. While <em>scale</em> can undoubtedly be useful, <em>iteration</em> is the unsung hero of computational methods.</p>
      <p>Merging computational techniques with social scientific text analysis blurs qualitative and quantitative methods. While computational methods involve quantification, there is <strong>interpretation</strong> before, during, and after any quantification. Text analysis is about establishing whether patterns are present in a collection of texts and how they vary. Determining what these patterns mean and which are important, however, is a qualitative process. So, we look toward the centuries of scholarly analysis of texts to guide our computational workflows.</p>
