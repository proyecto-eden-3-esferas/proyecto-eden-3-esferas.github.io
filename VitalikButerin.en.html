      <h1>Vitalik Buterin</h1>
      <p>Vitalik Buterin is a Russian-Canadian programmer and writer born in Moscow in 1994. He is most famous for co-founding <cite>Bitcoin Magazine</cite> in 2012 and the <strong>Ethereum</strong> blockchain project in 2015, which has grown to become the world&apos;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>

        <h2>Work with Glen Weyl</h2>
        <p>Buterin came into contact with economist Glen Weyl after tweeting about Weyl&apos;s proposal for a new wealth tax. The two then wrote a manifesto <cite>Liberation Through Radical Decentralization</cite>, where they highlighted the common ground between Buterin&apos;s work on cryptocurrencies and Weyl&apos;s work on market-based solutions to social problems. Collaborating with Zoe Hitzig, a PhD student at Harvard, they published a paper in 2019 entitled <cite>A Flexible Design for Funding Public Goods</cite>. The paper sets out a method for optimal provision of public goods, using a version of <strong>quadratic voting</strong>. As of August 2022, quadratic funding had been used to allocate over $20 million to open-source software projects, primarily through Gitcoin Grants.</p>

        <h2>Vitalik Buterin&apos;s Philosophy</h2>

          <h3>Plurality philosophy in an incredibly oversized nutshell</h3>
          <p style="text-align: right">2024 Aug 21</p>
          <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite><a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html">https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/08/21/plurality.html</a>)</p>
          <p>One of the interesting tensions in the crypto space, which has become a sort of digital home for my geographically nomadic self over the last decade, is its relationship to the topic of governance. The crypto space hails from the cypherpunk movement, which values independence from external constraints often imposed by ruthless and power-hungry politicians and corporations, and has for a long time built technologies like torrent networks and encrypted messaging to achieve these ends. With newer ideas like blockchains, cryptocurrencies and DAOs, however, there is an important shift: these newer constructions are long-lived, and constantly evolving, and so they have an inherent need to build their own governance, and not just circumvent the governance of unwanted outsiders. The ongoing survival of these structures depends crucially on mathematical research, open source software, and other large-scale public goods. This requires a shift in mentality: the ideology that maintains the crypto space needs to transcend the ideology that created it.</p>
          <p>These kinds of complex interplays between coordination and freedom, especially in the context of newer technologies, are everywhere in our modern society, going far beyond blockchains and cryptocurrency. Earlier this year, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that would ban synthetic (aka <q>lab-grown</q>) meat from the state, arguing that <q>global elites want to control our behavior and push a diet of petri dish meat and bugs on Americans</q>, and that we need to <q>prioritize our farmers and ranchers over ... the World Economic Forum</q>. As you might expect, the Libertarian Party New Hampshire account publicly criticized the <q>authoritarian socialist</q> nature of the legislation. But as it turned out, many other self-described libertarians did not share the same opinion:</p>
          <p>To me, LPNH&apos;s criticism of DeSantis&apos;s ban makes total sense: banning people from eating a new and potentially far more ethical and sustainable form of meat, on the basis of little more than a disgust reflex, is the exact opposite of valuing freedom. And yet, it&apos;s clear that many others do not feel the same way. When I scoured the internet for cogent arguments why, the most compelling I could find is this argument from Roko Mijic: in short, once something like this is allowed, it becomes mainstream, society reorganizes around it, and the lives of those who do not want to follow along inevitably become harder and harder. It happened with digital cash, to the point where even the Swedish central bank is worried about cash payments accessibility, so why wouldn&apos;t it happen in other sectors of technology as well?</p>
          <p>About two weeks after the DeSantis signed the bill banning lab-grown meat, Google announced that it was rolling out a feature into Android that would analyze the contents of calls in real time, and would automatically give the user a warning if it thinks the user might be getting scammed. Financial scams are a large and growing problem, especially in regions like Southeast Asia, and they are becoming increasingly sophisticated more rapidly than many people can adapt. AI is accelerating this trend. Here, we see Google, creating a solution to help warn users about scams, and what&apos;s more, the solution is entirely client-side: there&apos;s no personal data being shipped off to any corporate or governmental Big Brother. This seems amazing; it&apos;s exactly the kind of tech that I advocated for in my post introducing <q>d/acc</q>. However, not all freedom-minded people were happy, and at least one of the detractors was very difficult to dismiss as <q>just a Twitter troll</q>: it was Meredith Whittaker, president of the Signal Foundation.</p>
          <p>All three of these tensions are examples of things that have made a deep philosophical question repeatedly pop into my mind: what is the thing that people like myself, who think of ourselves as principled defenders of freedom, should actually be defending? What is the updated version of Scott Alexander&apos;s notion of liberalism as a peace treaty that makes sense in the twenty first century? Clearly, the facts have changed. Public goods are much more important than before, at larger scales than before. The internet has made communication abundant, rather than scarce. As Henry Farrell analyzed in his book on weaponized interdependence, modern information technology doesn&apos;t just empower the recipient: it also enables ongoing power projection by the creator. Existing attempts to deal with these questions are often haphazard, trying to treat them as exceptions that require principles to be tempered by pragmatic compromise. But what if there was a principled way of looking at the world, which values freedom and democracy, that can incorporate these challenges, and deal with them as a norm rather than an exception?</p>
