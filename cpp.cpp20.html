        <dt>Concepts</dt>
        <dd>Concepts provide a way to express the intent of a template more clearly.  They allow developers to specify constraints on template parameters, which can make templates easier to use and errors easier to understand.  For instance, a developer can specify that a template parameter T must be a sortable container.  The compiler will enforce this constraint, providing clear error messages when the constraint is not met.  This feature can significantly improve the readability and maintainability of template-heavy code, which is common in complex backend systems.</dd>

        <dt>Ranges</dt>
        <dd>The ranges library, another addition in C++20, provides a new way to work with sequences of data.  It promotes a more functional style of programming and can lead to code that is more readable and self-explanatory.  This is particularly beneficial when processing large amounts of data in the backend, as it allows for more intuitive and concise data manipulation.  Ranges can simplify complex data transformations and make the code easier to understand and maintain.</dd>

        <dt>Coroutines</dt>
        <dd>Coroutines simplify asynchronous programming by making asynchronous code appear as if it were synchronous. This is a game-changer in backend development, where handling multiple tasks simultaneously, such as processing multiple client requests, is common.  Coroutines can make the code more readable and less error-prone by eliminating the need for callbacks or promises, which are traditionally used in asynchronous programming.  This can lead to cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to reason about.</dd>

        <dt>Modules</dt>
        <dd>Modules, another feature introduced in C++20, can help reduce compilation times and make it easier to manage dependencies.  This can be particularly beneficial in large backend codebases, where compilation time can be a significant issue.  Modules allow for better encapsulation and separation of code, making the codebase easier to navigate and understand.  They also improve build times and can help prevent issues related to name collisions and macros.</dd>

        <dt>Format Library</dt>
        <dd>C++20 introduced std::format, a new way to format strings.  It's safer and more feature-rich than printf, and more type-safe than iostreams.  This is particularly beneficial for generating responses or logs in a backend context.  The std::format function provides a wide range of formatting capabilities and is designed to be type-safe, extensible, and intuitive to use.  This can help prevent common errors associated with string formatting and manipulation, leading to safer and more robust backend applications.</dd>
