      <h1>Data Set</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A <dfn>data set</dfn>, sometimes spelled <q>dataset</q>, is a collection of related data that&apos;s usually organized in a standardized format. Data sets are used for analytics, business intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI) model training and a variety of other use cases. Data sets can vary significantly in both size and type of data. For example, a data set might contain information about tree species, ocean temperatures, regional sales totals, fruit prices, lottery winners, diseases or just about any other type of data.</p>
        <p>Although formats differ from one data set to another, their underlying organization can often be conceptualized as columns and rows, such as those found in spreadsheets or database tables. Each column represents a variable that describes the data, and each row represents a record that contains a related set of variable values. A value within a data set is sometimes referred to as <dfn>datum</dfn> or <dfn>data point</dfn>.</p>
        <h3>Data set vs. database</h3>
        <p>The term data set is sometimes confused with the term <a href="database.html">database</a>, but the two have different meanings. A database is used to store and manage data. It is part of a larger management platform that includes features for securing, accessing, updating and in other ways working with and protecting data. A data set is simply a file or other structure that contains the data values in a specific format. A database might contain the data from one or more data sets, but the two are not the same.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every column of a table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given record of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set.</p>
        <p>Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files.</p>
        <h3>Properties</h3>
        <p>Several characteristics define a data set&apos;s structure and properties. These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various statistical measures applicable to them, such as standard deviation and kurtosis.</p>
        <p>The values may be numbers, such as real numbers or integers, for example representing a person&apos;s height in centimeters, but may also be nominal data (i.e., not consisting of numerical values), for example representing a person&apos;s ethnicity.<del> More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement.</del> For each variable, the values are normally all of the same kind. Missing values may exist, which must be indicated somehow.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A dataset is a snapshot of all the information in a database at a given moment in time. The data in a dataset is further segmented into structures called tables. A table contains information that goes together. For example, all of the people in an address book could go in a table called <cite>Contacts</cite>.</p>
