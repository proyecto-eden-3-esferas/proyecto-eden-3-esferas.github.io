      <h1>Muscle Tissue</h1>
      <p>The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle. All of these are composed of cells with a high concentration of proteins. The proteins and their arrangement allow muscle cells to contract.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Skeletal muscle tissue makes up the skeletal muscles that move the body and control body openings. Skeletal muscle cells are cylindrical, appear striated (striped), and have multiple nuclei pushed off to the side.</li>
        <li>Smooth muscle tissue can be found in the walls of hollow organs, veins, and arteries. This tissue allows hollow organs to move materials through them and allows vessels to change their diameter. Smooth muscle cells are spindle-shaped (taper at the ends), do not appear striated, and have one nucleus per cell.</li>
        <li>Cardiac muscle tissue is found in the walls of the heart and is specially adapted to not fatigue. Cardiac muscle cells branch, appear striated, and have one nucleus per cell. Specialized junctions between cells (intercalated disks) allow for fast transmission of electrical impulses.</li>
      </ul>
