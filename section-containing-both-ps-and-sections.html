      <h1>A Section Containing both Paragraphs and (Sub)Sections</h1>
      <p>An HTML document (or generally a document in any other text-oriented XML) will have block and non-block elements. For instance, a paragraph (called &apos;p&apos; in HTML, &apos;para&apos; in DocBook, and so on) is a block element. And so are sections (tagged &apos;div&apos; in HTML), chapters and so on.</p>
      <p>Paragraphs are different from sections in that they cannot hold block elements themselves. So what about a section (a sectioning element) holding paragraphs <em>and</em> further sections?</p>
      <p>To begin with, somehow it would seem weird for a paragraph to live <em>between</em> two sections or right <em>after</em> all other sections. Picture it. You have a chapter comprising several sections plus a paragraph after all the sections, at the very end of the chapter. How do you navigate to the paragraph?</p>
      <p>To some people, having paragraphs <em>before</em> all the sections does not make much sense either. Why?</p>
      <p>Let us go back a little bit. What sets paragraphs apart is that they don&apos;t have a title, whereas sections usually do. So we would be ruling out, or discriminating against, elements without a title or their own. They <q>inherit</q> the title of the element that contains them...</p>
