      <h1>Quinoa (<i lang="la">Chenopodium quinoa</i>)</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>quinoa</strong>, (<i lang="la">Chenopodium quinoa</i>), plant species grown for its tiny edible seeds. Quinoa is not a true cereal, and its seeds are high in protein and fiber. The young leaves are also nutritious and can be eaten as a vegetable similar to spinach (to which it is related). The plant is native to the Andean region of South America, where it has been a staple crop for millennia. Touted for its health benefits, quinoa is now grown in a number of countries around the world, including the United States, Canada, Italy, Sweden, and India, but most of it is still grown in Peru and Bolivia.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Quinoa is an annual herbaceous plant that can reach up to 3 meters (9.8 feet) in height, depending on the race. Its thick cylindrical stalk can be straight or branching and bears alternate leaves that range from lanceolate (tapering to a point) to roughly triangular. Both the stalk and the leaves fade in color from green to yellow, red, or purple as they age.</p>
          <p>Its flowers are small and apetalous (lacking petals) and grow clustered in racemose (simple and unbranching) inflorescences. The flowers are mostly bisexual or pistillate (female) and are generally self-pollinated, though some cross-pollination does occur. The tiny seeds, produced in achene fruits, are about 2 mm (0.08 inch) in diameter and can be white, red, yellow, purple, brown, or black.</p>
          <p>Quinoa has an extensive branching taproot that can be up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) deep and promotes drought resistance. The plants are also frost-resistant and salt-tolerant and can be grown in poor soils, making the species attractive to numerous food security programs and to agricultural researchers as an alternative crop. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has expressed interest in quinoa for its potential to be grown aboard spacecraft to support crews on long-term missions.</p>

        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Since its promotion by American entrepreneurs David Cusack, Steve Gorad, and Don McKinley and by agricultural researcher Duane Johnson in the late 1970s, quinoa has been hailed as a superfood and has grown in popularity around the world. Compared with traditional cereals, quinoa contains all nine essential amino acids, making it one of the few plant sources of complete protein. The seeds are also high in fiber and oil and are a good source of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, zinc, copper, vitamin E, and a number of antioxidants. The seeds have a slightly nutty flavor and are similar to brown rice in texture. Extremely versatile, quinoa can be used in any number of sweet or savory dishes and is commonly boiled like rice or ground as a flour to fortify baked goods. Its nutritious young leaves can be steamed or saut√©ed and are similar in taste and texture to spinach or beet greens.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>Quinoa has several industrial applications due to its high levels of bitter saponins. Found on the outside of the seeds, the saponins are cardiac glycosides (organic compounds that interfere with heart contractions) that must be processed from most varieties prior to consumption, usually by mechanically removing the pericarp (ovary wall) or by soaking in water. Those waste saponins can then be used to produce pharmaceuticals, such as synthetic steroids, and can be used in soaps, detergents, cosmetics, beer production, and fire extinguishers.</p>

        <section id="amaranth-vs-quinoa">
          <h3>Quinoa vs. Amaranth</h3>
          <p>Because these seeds are from the same family, they share several qualities. Although amaranth and quinoa are referred to as ancient grains, they are both seeds; the two pseudocereals are also naturally gluten-free. Compared to other grains, amaranth and quinoa have short cooking times, although it does take slightly longer for amaranth to reach the desired doneness.</p>
          <p>A visual difference is size: amaranth is a much smaller grain than quinoa. Another obvious differentiation is found in the aroma and flavor. Amaranth is much more distinctive compared to quinoa, with a grassy smell and nutty, strong herbal taste that can be overwhelming for some. While quinoa&apos;s mildness allows it to take on the flavors of the other ingredients in the dish, amaranth takes center stage.</p>
