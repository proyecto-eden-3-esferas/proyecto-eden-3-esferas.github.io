      <h1>Pattern Languages</h1>
      <p>A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns, each of which describes a problem and the core of a solution that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise. The term was coined by architect <a target="_blank" href="christopher-alexander.html">Christopher Alexander</a> and popularized by his 1977 book <cite>A Pattern Language</cite>.</p>
      <p>A pattern language can also be an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected patterns. <strong>Aliveness</strong> is one placeholder term for <q>the quality that has no name</q>: a sense of wholeness, spirit, or grace, that while of varying form, is precise and empirically verifiable. Alexander claims that ordinary people can use this design approach to successfully solve very large, complex design problems.</p>

      <p>Elemental or universal patterns such as <q>door</q> or <q>partnership</q> are versatile ideals of design, either as found in experience or for use as components in practice, explicitly described as holistic resolutions of the forces in recurrent contexts and circumstances, whether in architecture, medicine, software development or governance, etc. Patterns might be invented or found and studied, such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments.</p>

      <p>Like all languages, a pattern language has vocabulary, syntax, and semantics – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication. In pattern languages for design, the parts break down in this way:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The language description – the <dfn>vocabulary</dfn> – is a collection of named, described solutions to problems in a field of interest. These are called <dfn>design patterns</dfn>. So, for example, the language for architecture describes items like: settlements, buildings, rooms, windows, latches, etc.</li>
        <li>Each solution includes <dfn>syntax</dfn>, a description that shows where the solution fits in a larger, more comprehensive or more abstract design. This automatically links the solution into a web of other needed solutions. For example, rooms have ways to get light, and ways to get people in and out.</li>
        <li>The solution includes semantics that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit. So, if the benefit is unneeded, the solution is not used. Perhaps that part of the design can be left empty to save money or other resources; if people do not need to wait to enter a room, a simple doorway can replace a waiting room.</li>
        <li>In the language description, semantics and syntax cross index (often with a literal alphabetic index of pattern names) to other named solutions, so the designer can quickly think from one solution to related, needed solutions, and document them in a logical way. In Christopher Alexander&apos;s book <cite>A Pattern Language</cite>, the patterns are in decreasing order by size, with a separate alphabetic index.</li>
        <li>The web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts. At the same time, if the pattern language has worked well for many projects, there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process, and the result will be usable.</p>

        <h2>Simple example of a pattern</h2>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Name</strong>: ChocolateChipRatio</p>
          <p><strong>Context</strong>: You are baking chocolate chip cookies in small batches for family and friends</p>
          <p><strong>Consider these patterns first</strong>: SugarRatio, FlourRatio, EggRatio</p>
          <p><strong>Problem</strong>: Determine the optimum ratio of chocolate chips to cookie dough</p>
          <p><strong>Solution</strong>: Observe that most people consider chocolate to be the best part of the chocolate chip cookie. Also observe that too much chocolate may prevent the cookie from holding together, decreasing its appeal. Since you are cooking in small batches, cost is not a consideration. Therefore, use the maximum amount of chocolate chips that results in a really sturdy cookie.</p>
          <p><strong>Consider next</strong>: NutRatio or CookingTime or FreezingMethod</p>
