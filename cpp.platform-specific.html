      <h1>Platform-Specific Features in C++</h1>
      <p>C++ is a great general-purpose language. Thanks to the <a target="_blank" href="cpp.stl.html">Standard Library</a>, the language is packed with so many features that a casual programmer could happily code in C++ for years without going beyond what is built in. However, professional programs require facilities that C++ does not provide. This section lists several important features that are provided by the platform or third-party libraries, not by the C++ language or the C++ Standard Library:</p>

      <dl>

        <dt>Networking</dt>
        <dd>The Internet has changed the way we write applications. These days, most applications check for updates through the web, and games provide a networked multiplayer mode. C++ does not provide a mechanism for networking yet, though several standard libraries exist. The most common means of writing networking software is through an abstraction called sockets. A socket library implementation can be found on most platforms, and it provides a simple procedure-oriented way to transfer data over a network. Some platforms support a <a target="_blank" href="programming.streams.html">stream</a>-based networking system that operates like I/O streams in C++. There are also third-party networking libraries available that provide a networking abstraction layer. These libraries often support many different target platforms. Choosing a networking library that is IPv-independent would be a better choice than choosing one that only supports IPv4, as IPv6 is already being used.</dd>

        <dt>Graphical user interfaces</dt>
        <dd>Most commercial programs today run on an operating system that has a graphical user interface, containing such elements as clickable buttons, movable windows, and hierarchical menus. C++, like the C language, has no notion of these elements. To write a graphical application in C++, you can use platform-specific libraries that allow you to draw windows, accept input through the mouse, and perform other graphical tasks. A better option is to use a third-party library, such as wxWidgets (<a target="_blank" href="https://wxwidgets.org/">https://wxwidgets.org</a>), Qt (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.qt.io/">qt.io</a>), Uno (<a target="_blank" href="https://platform.uno/">platform.uno</a>), and many more that provide an abstraction layer for building graphical applications. These libraries often provide support for many different target platforms.</dd>

        <dt>OS events and application interaction</dt>
        <dd>In pure C++ code, there is little interaction with the surrounding operating system and other applications. The command-line arguments are about all you get in a standard C++ program without platform extensions. For example, operations such as copy and paste (which interact with the operating system&apos;s <q>clipboard</q>) are not directly supported in C++. You can either use platform-provided libraries or use third-party libraries that support multiple platforms. For example, both wxWidgets and Qt are examples of libraries that abstract the clipboard operations and support multiple platforms.</dd>

        <dt>Low-level files</dt>
        <dd>Many operating systems provide their own file APIs, which are usually incompatible with the standard file classes in C++. These libraries often provide OS-specific file tools, such as a mechanism to get the home directory of the current user.</dd>

        <dt>Threads</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Concurrent threads of execution within a single program were not directly supported in C++03 or earlier. Since C++11, a threading support library has been included with the Standard Library<!--, as explained in Chapter 27, “Multithreaded Programming with C++,”--> and C++17 has added parallel algorithms<!--, as discussed in Chapter 20, “Mastering Standard Library Algorithms”-->. If you need more powerful threading functionality besides what the Standard Library provides, then you need to use third-party libraries.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are doing cross-platform development and you need functionality not provided by the C++ language or the C++ Standard Library, you should try to find a third-party cross-platform library that provides the functionality you require. If, instead, you start using platform-specific APIs directly, then you are complicating your cross-platform code a lot, as you will have to implement the functionality for each platform you need to support.</p>
          <p><strong>Note:</strong> When using third-party libraries, if possible, get these libraries as source code and build them yourself with the exact toolchains you need.</p>
