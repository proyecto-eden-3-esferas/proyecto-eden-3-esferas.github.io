        <p>RAM stands for random access memory, and it is where your computer stores data temporarily while running applications.</p>

          <h3>Faulty RAM</h3>
          <p>If your computer is experiencing random crashes, blue screens, or performance issues, you might have a faulty RAM module.  A faulty RAM module can cause various problems, such as data corruption, system instability, or boot failure.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, you can fix a faulty RAM module by following some simple steps. Here we shall show you how to diagnose, remove, and replace a faulty RAM module.</p>
          <p>You can use a software tool called MemTest86 to test your RAM for errors. MemTest86 is a free program that you can download and run from a USB drive or a CD. To use MemTest86, you need to boot your computer from the USB drive or the CD, and then follow the instructions on the screen. MemTest86 will scan your RAM for errors and display the results. If you see any red lines or numbers, it means that your RAM has errors and needs to be fixed.</p>

          <h3>CSM (Compatibility Support Module)</h3>
          <p>CSM stands for Compatibility Support Module, which is an option found in many computers&apos; BIOS settings. This option allows users to select between two different boot modes: UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) mode or Legacy BIOS-Compatibility mode.</p>
          <p>Enabling this module will allow the computer to launch OSes that are not compatible with UEFI, such as Windows 7, XP, etc., while disabling it will restrict the user to only using OSes compatible with UEFI, such as Windows 10.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that since most modern systems come pre-configured with UEFI enabled by default, most users won&apos;t need to use the CSM setting unless they are having trouble booting certain OS versions on their computer.</p>

          <h4>So What Is CSM Used For?</h4>
          <p>You may need to use CSM if you&apos;re trying to install an operating system that has a different bitness than the firmware on your computer. This is common when installing pre-SP1 Windows Vista or earlier, or a 32-bit OS on a machine with 64-bit UEFI.</p>
          <p>BIOS boot usually requires MBR partitioning, while some bootloaders support GPT partitioning schemes. UEFI boot typically requires the bitness of the OS and firmware to match – most UEFI machines have 64-bit firmware.</p>
          <p>CSM allows you to override this restriction and install an OS even with mismatched bitnesses. Understanding how your PC is set up is important for deciding whether or not you should enable CSM in BIOS.</p>

          <h4>Should You Enable or Disable CSM Support?</h4>
          <p>Deciding whether or not to activate the Compatibility Support Module (CSM) in your system&apos;s UEFI firmware depends on the Windows version you&apos;re running. If you&apos;ve got a newer device with Windows 10 pre-installed, chances are it&apos;s been disabled by default and you don&apos;t need to enable CSM support.</p>
          <p>But if you&apos;re attempting to install an older OS that doesn&apos;t support UEFI, it must be enabled manually. To ensure that your computer runs as intended, though, it&apos;s important to understand how this works and what implications come with activating the CSM module.</p>
          <p>I have noticed that some older laptops and desktops required a BIOS update – to enable the user to enable/disable CSM and UEFI. So please do so before you change any setting!</p>

          <h4>How to Enable or Disable CSM Support for Various Brands?</h4>
          <p>Enabling or disabling CSM support in BIOS is easy to do on ASUS, Gigabyte, ASRock, and MSI motherboards.</p>
          <p>To get started, you&apos;ll need to follow the steps for each motherboard type.</p>
