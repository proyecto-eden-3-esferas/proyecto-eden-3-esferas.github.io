      <blockquote>
        <p>If there is a single claim, that I could make, in order to distinguish Permaculture from other systems of agriculture, with the notable exception of keyline concepts, it is that Permaculture is primarily a consciously designed agricultural system ... a system that combines landscape design with perennial plants and animals to make a safe and sustainable resource for town and country. A truly appropriate technology giving high yields for low energy inputs, and using only human skill and intellect to achieve a stable resource of great complexity and stability.</p>

      <section id="what">
        <h2>What is Permaculture?</h2>
        <p><dfn>Permaculture</dfn> is a design science that focuses on crafting productive, diverse, and resilient ecosystems to meet our needs as humans, while also benefiting all life forms.</p>
        <p>Permaculture design could also be referred to as <strong>ecological design</strong>, <strong>holistic design</strong>, or <strong>whole systems design</strong>.</p>
        <p>The focus is on the relationships, connections, patterns, and energy flows between various elements and actors within a system.</p>
        <p>The term permaculture was coined by Bill Mollison in the 1970s as he crafted a movement of <q>permanent agriculture</q> aimed at resilient, regenerative, and sustainable production to meet our needs.</p>
        <p>Mollison did extensive research and adopted and adapted the influence and knowledge of many indigenous cultures and other philosophers and writers to form what became the permaculture he wrote and taught extensively on.</p>
        <p>The movement pushes back against common modern approaches that focus on control, dominance, and mastery over nature, linear production, dependent consumers, and open loop systems.</p>
        <section id="permanent-culture">
          <h3>Permanent Agriculture to Permanent Culture</h3>
          <p>Over the decades, permaculture philosophy and application have been expanded and adapted.</p>
          <p>Many now consider the root term “permanent culture” to be more representative of the diverse applications of permaculture design in all areas of our lives.</p>
          <p>Some applications of permaculture include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emotional</li>
            <li>Social</li>
            <li>Economic</li>
            <li>Political</li>
            <li>Agricultural</li>
            <li>Building</li>
            <li>Technological</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>The problem is the solution</h3>
          <p>One of the most liberating aspects of permaculture is looking at the problem as the solution. By taking a different approach, we can use a perceived obstacle as a positive attribute instead.</p>
          <p>For example, if we have a cold wind blowing across our land, how do we use its strength and cooling properities to our advantage in any design? Do we have a duck deficiency rather than a slug problem? Constantly damp piece of land? It can be transformed into a bog garden.</p>
          <p>Everything can be a positive resource; it is just up to us to work out how we use it. Conversely, don't waste time, money or energy trying to force something into being that nature never intended!</p>

      <section id="ethics">
        <h2>Permaculture Ethics</h2>
        <p>Three guiding ethics create the foundational thought process whenever we apply permaculture practices: earth care, people care, and fair share.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Earth Care</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Earth care is the consideration of how our behaviours, actions, designs, and daily activities affect the environment around us.</p>
            <p>Nothing we do is separate from nature and it&apos;s crucial we are aware of how we impact and relate to the living and non-living environment.</p>
            <p>Unlike some hardline environmentalist movements, the goal is not to have zero impact (as that&apos;s impossible), rather it&apos;s to be mindful of our choices on how we consume, how we move through and live with the land, and how we support nature&apos;s ability to maintain its diverse and resilient systems.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>People Care</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Similar to earth care, people care is the consideration of how our behaviours, actions, designs and daily activities affect the people around us.</p>
            <p>This consideration is extended, not only to those immediately around us, but also to those within our communities, and to those further out who we may be connected to via global systems of supply and consumption.</p>
            <p>Permaculture is about forming a <q>permanent culture</q> and you can&apos;t have culture without people. It&apos;s important to consider how everyone is interconnected within a larger system.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>Fair Share/Future Care</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Fair share has often been referred to as the tricky <q>third ethic</q> as it&apos;s been interpreted in so many varying ways.</p>
            <p>At its core, fair share aims to recognize and address the inequalities and power imbalances that exist on all levels. The idea being that a system is not truly sustainable if it requires a portion of the population be exploited and/or excluded.</p>
            <p>There is also a time scale component to the third ethic which recognizes the future impacts that our actions will have and considers how future generations (of all species) may have to do deal with that.</p>

      <section id="principles">
        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>Right from the start Permaculture has been principles-based. Bill Mollison and David Holmgren have given us three sets of the <cite>Permaculture Principles</cite> (<i>below</i>). Today Permaculturalists refer to these principles all the time, for inspiration with their designs. These principles are at the heart of all Permaculture teaching.</p>

        <section id="diversity">
          <h3>Diversity</h3>
          <p>In his book <cite>Plants, Man, and Life</cite>, Edgar Andersen describes the garden/orchard plantings grouped around the houses in Central America. Close to the house and more or less surrounding it is a compact garden-orchard some 20 square metres in extent. No two of these are exactly alike. There are neat plantations more or less grouped together. There are various fruit trees (citrus, custard apple, sapote, mango and avocado), and a thicket of coffee bushes in the shade of the larger trees. There are tapioca (cassava) plants of one or two varieties, grown more or less in rows at the edge of the trees. Frequently there are patches of banana; corn and beans here and there in rows or patches. Climbing and scrambling over all are vines of various squashes and their relatives: the chayote (choko) grown for its squashes, as well as its big starchy root; and the luffa gourd, its skeleton used for dishrags and sponges. The cucurbits clamber over the eaves of the house and run along the ridgepole, climb high in the trees, or festoon the fence. Setting off the whole garden are flowers and various useful weeds (dahlias, rosemay, gladioli, climbing roses, asparagus fern, cannas and grain amaranth).</p>

          <p>Andersen is contrasting the strict, ordered, linear, segmented thinking of Europeans with the productive, more natural polyculture of the dry tropics. The order he describes is a semi-natural order of plants, in their right relationship to each other (<a target="_blank" href="guilds.html">guilds</a>), but not separated into various artificial groupings. It is no longer clear where orchard, field, house and garden have their boundaries, where annuals and perennials belong, or indeed where cultivation gives way to naturally-evolved systems.</p>
          <p>To the observer, this may seem like a very unordered and untidy system; however, we should not confuse order and tidiness. Tidiness separates species and creates work (and may also invite pests), whereas order integrates, reducing work and discouraging insect attack. European gardensj, often extraordinarily tidy, result in functional disorder and low yield. Creativity is seldom tidy. Perhaps we could say that tidiness is something that happens when compulsive activity replaces thoughful creativity.</p>
          <p>Although the yield of a monocultural system will probably be greater for a particualr crop than the yield of any one species in a permaculture system, the <em>sum of yields</em> in a mixed system will be larger. In the former, a hectare of vegetables will yield only vegetables throughout the year. In the latter, vegetables are a smaller part of the total yield of nuts, fruit, oil crop, timber, poultry, firewood, fish, seedcrop, and animal protein.</p>
          <p>For self-reliance, this means that a family can satisfy all its nutritional needs with the available fruits, vegetables, proteins, and minerals. Economically, having more saleable products at different times of the year protects a family from market downturns and severe losses of one crop due to pests or bad weather. If the market for beef is down one year, for example, only firewood, nuts, fruit, seedcrop, and herbs are sold, keeping the cattle for better times. If frosts wipe out the fruit crop, other produce is available to eat or to sell.</p>

          <p>Our aim should be to disperse yield over time, so that products are available during every season. This aim is achieved in a variety of ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>by selection of early, mid and late season varieties;</li>
            <li>by planting the same variety in early or late-ripening situations;</li>
            <li>by selection of long-yielding species;</li>
            <li>by a general increase in <a href="organic-diversity.html">diversity</a> or multi-use species in the system, so that leaf, fruit, seed and root are all product yields;</li>
            <li>by using self-storing species such as tubers, hard seeds, nuts or rhizomes which can be dug on demand;</li>
            <li>by techniques such as preserving, drying, pitting, freezing, and cool storage; and</li>
            <li>by regional trade within and between communities, or by purchasing land at different altitudes and latitudes.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr/>
          <p>Diversity is often related to stability in a permaculture. However, stability only occurs among <em>cooperative</em> species, or species that do each other no harm. It is not enough to simply place as many plants and animals as you can into a system, as they may compete with each other for light, nutrient, and water. Some plants, such as walnuts and eucalypts, inhibit the growth of others by releasing chemicals from their roots into the soil (<dfn>allelopathy</dfn>). Other plants provide overwintering habitat for pests and diseases harmful to nearby plants. Cows an horses grazed on the same pasture will eventually degrade it. Large trees compete with grain crops for light. Goats in the orchard or woodlot debark trees. Therefore, if we are to use all these elements in a system, we must be careful to place an intervening plant or structure between potentially harmful elements.</p>
          <p>So the importance of diversity is not so much the number of functional elements in a system; rather it is the number of <em>functional connections</em> between these elements. It is not the number of things, but the number of ways in which things work. Whate we seek is a <dfn><a target="_blank" href="guilds.html">guild</a></dfn> of elements (plants, animals or structures) that work harmoniously together.</p>

        <section id="relative-location">
          <h3>Relative Location: Zones and Sectors</h3>
          <p>The placement of elements in relation to each other within a permaculture design will greatly impact the energy flows, efficiency, and relationships formed. Two approaches to addressing the spatial aspect of permaculture design are zones and sectors.</p>
          <section id="zones">
            <h4>Zones</h4>
            <p><dfn>Zones</dfn> can be thought of as use-patterns within a space. These will vary depending on the specific context and they don&apos;t generally have clear boundaries between them. They can be thought of in terms of how often an area is visited, how much time is spent there, and how much attention the elements within that zone require.</p>
            <p>The concept of zones can be very useful when determining placement of elements within a design</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Zone 0</strong> your self and your day-to-day activities. 24/7.</li>
              <li><strong>Zone 1</strong> areas visited daily, often multiple times a day, or for longer periods of time. This can include your home and the area immediately around it, workspace, etc. Elements in this zone require a higher level of maintenance or are something you want to interact with often.  </li>
              <li><strong>Zone 2</strong> areas visited regularly, usually daily or every other day. Elements in this space are slightly less accessible and do not require as much attention and maintenance as zone 1 elements.</li>
              <li><strong>Zone 3</strong> less frequently used spaces. Visited maybe weekly or monthly. Elements here would be more self-reliant and less dependent on your management.</li>
              <li><strong>Zone 4</strong> Seasonal or infrequently used spaces. These spaces might only be visited during certain seasons or under certain circumstances. For example, an area that you forage during mushroom season. Elements here require very little to no maintenance.</li>
              <li><strong>Zone 5</strong> Wilderness areas or very infrequently visited areas. Elements you find here are not managed by you</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section id="sectors">
            <h4>Sectors</h4>
            <p><dfn>Sectors</dfn> are outside influences on your design over which you have no control. They may be general factors which affect the entire site (ex: climate) or factors that have a specific spatial element to consider (ex: direction of dominant wind patterns).</p>
            <p>A sector analysis will help place elements in appropriate places. For example, you wouldn&apos;t want to build a house in a high flood risk location.</p>
            <p>Sectors can be many things. Some to consider include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Climate and growing zone</li>
              <li>Soil types</li>
              <li>Sun angle patterns throughout the year</li>
              <li>Day length</li>
              <li>Shade cast patterns</li>
              <li>Dominant wind direction and common wind patterns</li>
              <li>Water flows, elevation, and topography</li>
              <li>Views you want to highlight or block out</li>
              <li>Wildlife</li>
              <li>Pollution</li>
              <li>Neighbours</li>
              <li>Noise</li>
              <li>Threats (fire, flood, people, etc.)</li>
              <li>Rules, regulations, restrictions, laws</li>
              <li>Cultural or social norms</li>
              <li>Dominant economic system</li>
              <li>Political unrest</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section id="scale-of-permanence">
          <h3>Scale of Permanence</h3>
          <p>Scale of Permanence refers to how difficult or time-consuming an element or feature would be to change.</p>
          <p>For example, climate and geology are relatively permanent (ie, they are very difficult or slow to change). Roads and buildings would be considered semi-permanent as they are changeable but may require a large amount of resources to do so. Plants, soils, and fences are highly changeable and are not permanent.</p>
          <p>Rating elements on their scale of permanence can help us prioritise projects and helps us consider things like where our effort is best spent or what changes might be harder to adjust in the future.</p>

      <section id="goals-and-practices">
        <h2>Goals and practices</h2>
        <p>The goal of permaculture is responsible production and land stewardship and sustainable agriculture. Those who practice permaculture argue that by shifting their focus toward production and limiting consumption, people can reduce their own ecological impact on the land, the food system, and the energy grid and extend Earth&apos;s limited natural resources for future generations, with the added benefit of maintaining plant and animal habitats. Practitioners note that living according to such a philosophy can be applied on a large scale. For example, planned real estate developments can be designed as ecovillages—that is, planned communities with dwellings built and operated with sustainable materials, renewable energy resources, and centrally located farms or community-supported gardens. Permaculture can also be applied on an individual scale, with small garden plots in suburban backyards.</p>
        <p>Some of the ideas of permaculture involve combining sustainable architecture and agroforestry with garden planning that includes companion and succession planting, soil fertility monitoring, rotational grazing, and incorporating renewable energy, such as using animal manure as the feedstock for a biogas digester. Wherever possible, various elements in the design should serve multiple functions. Raising chickens, for example, can provide eggs, meat, pest control, and soil enrichment: as they range throughout the garden, the birds dig, scratch, and till the soil, and their waste is a good source of nitrogen, which can be composted for use as fertilizer. Closed-loop agriculture, or zero-waste farming, is often cited as a goal of permaculture—by returning all the materials and nutrients used to produce plants and animals for human consumption to the soil, usually through composting or feeding plant excess to animals. This ensures that the soil stays healthy and will be able to produce crops in the future.</p>

        <h2>The Permaculture Design Process</h2>
        <p>The extensive philosophy of permaculture can feel overwhelming for new learners and you may be wondering how you can actually put all of this theory into practice.</p>
        <p>It doesn&apos;t help that permaculture is extremely site-specific and when you start looking into strategies and methods, a lot of the feedback you&apos;ll receive on what to do will be <q>it depends.</q> You&apos;ll be hard pressed to find a one-size fits all permaculture plan that you can easily apply to your situation. Instead, you&apos;ll have to work through the design process, applying the <a href="#ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="#principles">principles</a> within the context of what you&apos;re designing.</p>
        <p>The permaculture design process can be undertaken in a number of ways and there are many frameworks within which practitioners can design a permaculture system.</p>
        <p>I find Heather Jo Flores&apos; GOBRADIME process, which she outlines in her book <cite>Food Not Lawns</cite>, to be a comprehensive and extremely useful tool for this.</p>

      </section>

      <section id="simple-examples">
        <h2>Some (Simple) Examples of Permaculture</h2>
        <p>Here are some real-world examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal Vegetable Gardens</strong> Yes, growing veggies is a very basic example of permaculture! If you garden in an eco-friendly, natural way, you&apos;re already practicing permaculture. Remember, it is essentially just imitating systems that exist in nature, so starting a garden and using natural methods for things like pest control and fertilizing certainly counts.</li>
          <li><strong>Vermiculture</strong> <dfn>Vermiculture</dfn>, often called worm composting, is the practice of using worms to create rich compost. You&apos;re setting worms up to do what they do in nature, meaning you&apos;re engaged in permaculture.</li>
          <li><strong>Rainwater Collection</strong> When you collect or harvest rainwater and use that in your garden, you are watering your crops in a natural, sustainable way.  You are using what your environment gives you.</li>
          <li><strong>Food Forests</strong> Food forests are more advanced than your basic vegetable garden, but they&apos;re a fantastic example of permaculture. Food forests layer different types of edible plants, fungi, and animals together until it becomes a self-sustaining, natural system, which is the very goal of permaculture. These are all designed to imitate natural, resilient ecosystems and usually involve seven different layers that work together to live and thrive.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Building Practices</strong> This type of permaculture centers around using natural materials (like cob, bamboo, adobe, and more) to create buildings, homes, and other structures to minimize environmental impact.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="critiques">
        <h2>Critiques of permaculture</h2>
        <p>Critics of permaculture point out that it is unreasonable to expect most people—especially those in densely populated areas—to have the space, equipment, and time to raise their own food. In addition, some aspects of permaculture may be difficult to apply on an individual scale within an urban centre, such as human-waste composting projects, which may run afoul of municipal codes. Some elements—such as aquaculture or biogas digester systems—have start-up costs that can be prohibitively expensive. Some critics also note that high labour requirements and the prospect of lower crop yields may make permaculture inefficient economically, especially when competing with contemporary large-scale resource-intensive industrial farming.</p>

        <p>Moreover, AI Overview, by Google, points out (four) <cite>Challenges to Implementation</cite> of permaculture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Knowledge Gaps</strong> A significant portion of the population is unfamiliar with permaculture principles, making it difficult to encourage widespread adoption. Many farmers aren&apos;t familiar with permaculture, so there&apos;s a lack of knowledge on how to proceed. Widespread educational efforts are difficult, and many may not have the money it would take to shift their farming techniques to something new.</li>
          <li><strong>Societal Shift</strong> Embracing permaculture principles requires a considerable shift in mindset and habits, which can be challenging for individuals and communities to adopt.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding and Effort</strong> Transitioning to permaculture techniques can require financial investment and time, and there&apos;s a need for greater support and educational efforts to facilitate the change. A farmer might even incur <strong>short term losses</strong> as permaculture is a long-term solution. The switch may lead to some short-term losses, like smaller crop yields and some financial loss. However, proper permaculture rectifies that situation itself, and practitioners trade short-term losses for long-term gains.</li>
          <li><strong>More Suited to Small-Scale Farming</strong> Critics of permaculture often say that it&apos;s a practice more suited to small-scale operations and farms or gardens. While it&apos;s true that it&apos;s easier to institute permaculture designs and practices for smaller gardens than giant agricultural efforts, it isn&apos;t impossible. Furthermore, ermaculture doesn&apos;t have to serve as a solitary approach. For instance, areas may combine permaculture with sustainable forestry for a broader effect.</li>

        <h2>Permaculture as a Spiritual Path</h2>
        <p>(From <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://soulfulandwild.com.au/reflections/permaculture-as-a-spiritual-practice">https://soulfulandwild.com.au/reflections/permaculture-as-a-spiritual-practice</a></cite>)</p>
        <p>Beyond its practical applications, permaculture holds a unique potential to awaken our spiritual connection with the Earth. Here are some of the ways that permaculture can be utilised as a spiritual path:</p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
          <li><strong>Deepening Awareness:</strong> Permaculture encourages us to observe and understand the intricate web of relationships in nature. By spending time in quiet observation and immersing ourselves in the natural world, we cultivate a deeper sense of interconnectedness and develop a profound appreciation for the beauty and wisdom of the Earth.</li>
          <li><strong>Honouring Life:</strong> Permaculture recognises that all life has inherent value and plays a vital role in the ecosystem. By fostering biodiversity and promoting regenerative practices, we honour the intrinsic worth of all living beings and acknowledge our responsibility as stewards of the Earth.</li>
          <li><strong>Living in Harmony:</strong> Permaculture invites us to design our lives in harmony with natural patterns and processes. By embracing principles such as "observe and interact," "use and value renewable resources and services," and "produce no waste," we align our actions with the wisdom of nature, cultivating balance and harmony in our daily lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultivating Resilience:</strong> Just as ecosystems strive for resilience, permaculture teaches us to build resilience within ourselves. By nurturing our physical, mental, and emotional well-being, we develop the capacity to adapt and respond gracefully to life&apos;s challenges, fostering a sense of inner harmony and balance.</li>
          <li><strong>Community and Collaboration:</strong> Permaculture emphasises the importance of building strong and resilient communities. By working together, sharing knowledge, and supporting one another, we create a sense of belonging and interconnectedness, cultivating a spiritual bond based on cooperation and mutual care.</li>
