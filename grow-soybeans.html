      <h1>Soybeans: How to Grow</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(Mostly from <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean">Wikipedia</a></cite>)</p>

      <p>The <dfn>soybean</dfn> (also spellt<dfn>soy bean</dfn>) or <dfn>soya bean</dfn> (<i>Glycine max</i>) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses.</p>
      <p>Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, nattō, and tempeh. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.</p>
      <p>Soybeans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Soybean is a common protein source in feed for farm animals that in turn yield animal protein for human consumption.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>Among the legumes, the soybean is valued for its high (38–45%) protein content as well as its high (approximately 20%) oil content.</p>
        <p>Soybeans can be broadly classified as <q>vegetable</q> (garden) or field (oil) types. Vegetable types cook more easily, have a mild, nutty flavor, and better texture, are larger in size, higher in protein, and are lower in oil than field types. Tofu, soy milk, and soy sauce are among the top edible commodities made using soybeans.<!-- Producers prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans originally brought to the United States in the late 1930s.--> The <q>garden</q> cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting because there is a tendency for the pods to shatter upon reaching maturity.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Soy is a good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans or for people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat, according to the US Food and Drug Administration:</p>
        <blockquote>Soy protein products can be good substitutes for animal products because, unlike some other beans, soy offers a <q>complete</q> protein profile. [...] Soy protein products can replace animal-based foods—which also have complete proteins but tend to contain more fat, especially saturated fat—without requiring major adjustments elsewhere in the diet.</blockquote>
        <p>Although soybeans have high protein content, soybeans also contain high levels of protease inhibitors, which can prevent digestion. Protease inhibitors are reduced by cooking soybeans, and are present in low levels in soy products such as tofu and soy milk.</p>
