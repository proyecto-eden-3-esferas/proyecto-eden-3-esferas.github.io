      <h1>Biostumulants</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(Largely from <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fbn.com/community/blog/what-is-an-inoculant-and-how-to-apply-it">https://www.fbn.com/community/blog/what-is-an-inoculant-and-how-to-apply-it</a></cite>)</p>
      <p>A <dfn>biostumulant</dfn> is a substance or microorganism that, when applied to seeds, plants, or the rhizosphere, stimulates natural processes to enhance or benefit nutrient uptake, nutrient efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stress, or crop quality and yield. They may include fertilizers, soil amendments, inoculants etc.</p>
      <p>Many types of biostimulants are used in crop production, and each has different benefits. Common biostimulant effects on plants include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased stress tolerance and recovery</li>
        <li>Improved plant water and nutrient uptake, translocation, and use </li>
        <li>More robust root structure and growth</li>
        <li>Better disease tolerance</li>
        <li>Improved plant metabolism for enhanced yield and crop quality</li>
        <li>Enhanced quality characteristics of produce, including sugar content, color, fruit seeding, etc</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Biostimulants are often associated with organic production systems, but in the past decade, their popularity has grown among conventional growers.</p>
      <p>While the crop health benefits of biostimulants have been well documented, the mode of action of these products is not always well understood. Generally, biostimulants boost a plant&apos;s vigor, making it more tolerant to abiotic and biotic stress. However, biostimulants do not have a direct mode of action against weeds, diseases, or insects like herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides do.</p>
      <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Biostimulants</h2>
        <p>There are many biostimulant classes and formulations that may stimulate various plant responses. A specific product&apos;s efficacy may be affected by its raw ingredients and how it is manufactured, stored, and applied.</p>
        <p>Here are the most common biostimulants used in agricultural production.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Humic and Fulvic Acids</h3>
          <p>Humic and fulvic acids are the largest segment of the biostimulant market. They are organic acids that occur naturally in soil, resulting from the decomposition of plant, animal, and microbial residues. These acids can also come from soil microbe activity. Humic acids may be derived from non-renewable (mineral deposits like leonardite and soft coal) or renewable (<a target="_blank" href="composting.html">compost</a> or <a target="_blank" href="vermicomposting.html">vermicompost</a>) sources.</p>
          <p>Benefits of humic acids in agricultural production include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improving soil physiochemical properties</li>
            <li>Increasing root nutrient uptake</li>
            <li>Expanding lateral root development</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Seaweed Extracts</h3>
          <p>Seaweed extracts are another popular biostimulant class with a long history in agriculture. Farmers have used seaweed extracts to fertilize the soil and improve its structure for hundreds of years. However, the biostimulant effects of seaweed extracts are a relatively new development.</p>
          <p>Brown seaweeds, including species of the genera <i lang="la">Ascophyllum</i>, <i lang="la">Fucus</i>, and <i lang="la">Laminari</i>, are the most commonly used seaweeds in agricultural production. Different extraction processes are used to produce most seaweed biostimulant products and can affect overall product efficacy.</p>
          <p>Seaweed extracts are usually packaged as a soluble powder or liquid formulation. Beneficial polysaccharides account for 30-40% of the dry weight of seaweed extracts and are known to elicit plant defense responses against bacterial and fungal pathogens.</p>
          <p>Other benefits of seaweed extracts include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved plant growth and development from phenolic-rich compounds</li>
            <li>Improved nutrient uptake and utilization</li>
            <li>Soil conditioning and metal-chelating properties</li>
            <li>Increased water retention capacity in plants</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other plant extracts (<dfn>botanicals</dfn>) are increasingly being studied and used for their biostimulant effects.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Beneficial Bacteria</h3>
          <p>Plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPBs) are well-studied species of beneficial bacteria, including free-living bacteria that inhabit a plant&apos;s root zone, bacteria that colonize the root surface, and bacteria that live within plant roots.</p>
          <p>Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, and Azotobacter bacteria are popular in the biostimulant market. They offer many plant benefits; the most well-known is rhizobacteria&apos;s nitrogen-fixing capabilities in legume crops. Beneficial bacteria may be inoculated on the seed or applied directly to the soil.</p>
          <p>Other benefits of PGPBs include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Improved water and nutrient uptake</li>
            <li>Increased nutrient use efficiency</li>
            <li>Plant hormone stimulation and regulation</li>
            <li>Resistance to insects and non-beneficial bacterial pathogens</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While the modes of action and benefits of PGPBs are well understood and documented, they can be challenging to work with because they are living organisms sensitive to handling and extreme temperatures. PGPB biostimulants may not mix well with other crop protection products and often have limited shelf lives.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Beneficial Fungi</h3>
          <p>It&apos;s well-known that mycorrhizal fungi are vital to soil health and crop production. These fungi live symbiotically with plant roots to increase root mass and nutrient and water uptake.</p>
          <p>Other benefits of symbiotic fungi products include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased drought stress tolerance</li>
            <li>Improved phosphorus uptake in phosphorus-deficient soils</li>
            <li>Beneficial antifungal properties against plant fungal diseases</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As living organisms, beneficial fungi are sensitive to crop management practices, including soil tillage, fallow periods, and high rates of fertilizer and fungicides.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Chitosan &amp; Other Biopolymers</h3>
          <p><strong>Chitosans</strong> are derived from a naturally occurring biological building block, <strong>chitin</strong>, that supports fungal cell walls and the exoskeletons of insects. Chitosans can induce plant-defense responses, making plants more tolerant to abiotic and biotic stresses. Although these products&apos; exact modes of action have yet to be fully understood, more research is being done to support further product development.</p>
          <p>Benefits of chitosans and similar biopolymers include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral properties</li>
            <li>Soil amendment characteristics to reduce Fusarium wilt and other soilborne pathogen populations   </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Chitosan efficacy can vary greatly depending on how and when it is applied and the quality of raw materials and manufacturing processes.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Inorganic Compounds</h3>
          <p>Inorganic compounds include minerals such as silica, selenium, cobalt, and others, which promote plant growth, the quality of plant products, and abiotic stress tolerance.</p>
          <p>Some benefits of silicon, specifically, include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased plant resistance to diseases</li>
            <li>Increased photosynthesis efficiency</li>
            <li>Improved water and nutrient translocation</li>
            <li>Immobilization of toxic metals in the soil and plant tissues</li>
            <li>Delayed plant senescence</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Protein Hydrolysates</h3>
          <p><dfn>Protein hydrolysates</dfn> are amino-acid and peptide mixtures obtained by chemical and enzymatic protein hydrolysis from both plant sources and animal wastes. Crop residues and by-products and animal industrial by-products, including leather, collagen and epithelial tissues, are typical sources.</p>
          <p>The plant-based peptides, particularly, are the most interesting of the biostimulants due to their multifunctional activity. Protein hydrolysates are known to affect plant hormonal activities and metabolism.</p>
          <p>Benefits of protein hydrolysates may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased soil fertility</li>
            <li>Improved soil microbial activity</li>
            <li>Chelating properties to protect against heavy-metal soils</li>
            <li>Increased micronutrient uptake and translocation</li>
          </ul>
