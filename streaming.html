      <h1>Streaming</h1>
      <p><dfn>Streaming media</dfn> refers to multimedia delivered through a network for playback using a media player. Media is transferred in a stream of packets from a server to a client and is rendered in real-time; this contrasts with <dfn>file downloading</dfn>, a process in which the end-user obtains an entire media file before consuming the content. Streaming is more commonly used for video on demand, streaming television, and music streaming services over the Internet.</p>
      <p>While streaming is most commonly associated with multimedia from a remote server over the Internet, it also includes offline multimedia between devices on a local area network. For example, using DLNA and a home server, or in a personal area network between two devices using Bluetooth (which uses radio waves rather than IP).</p>
      <p>Online streaming was initially popularized by RealNetworks and Microsoft in the 1990s and has since grown to become the globally most popular method for consuming music and videos, with numerous competing subscription services being offered since the 2010s. Audio streaming to wireless speakers, often using Bluetooth, is another use that has become prevalent during that decade. Live streaming is the real-time delivery of content during production, much as live television broadcasts content via television channels.</p>

      <p>Distinguishing delivery methods from the media applies specifically to, as most of the traditional media delivery systems are either inherently streaming (e.g., radio, television) or inherently non-streaming (e.g., books, videotapes, audio CDs). The term <q>streaming media</q> can apply to media other than video and audio, such as live closed captioning, ticker tape, and real-time text, which are all considered <q>streaming text</q>.</p>

      <p>A media stream can be streamed either live or on demand. Live streams are generally provided by a method called <dfn>true streaming</dfn>. True streaming sends the information straight to the computer or device without saving it to a local file. On-demand streaming is provided by a method called <dfn>progressive download</dfn>. Progressive download saves the received information to a local file and then plays it from that location. On-demand streams are often saved to files for extended period of time, while live streams are only available at one time only (e.g., during a football game).</p>

What Kind of an Internet Connection Do I Need to Live Stream Virtual Music Concerts Online?
Although music is most important when you&apos;re live streaming music, we&apos;re assuming you&apos;ll also be live streaming video, to complete the vibe of your music. A typical 1080p video at 30 frames per second requires upload speeds between 3 Mbps and 6 Mbps - this is without counting the extra upload bandwidth needed for other online activities. That means that you need to make sure your Internet connection can steadily support that.

What you need to do is run an online speed test on the Internet connection you&apos;re going to use and with the setup you will have when live streaming your virtual concert. Notice the upload speed. If that&apos;s over 10 Mbps in general for a full-HD video, you should be fine.

If you&apos;re not getting that, you need to troubleshoot your Internet connection.

How to Successfully Live Stream a Music Event
As mentioned above, Internet connectivity is what makes or breaks a successful concert stream. If you&apos;re having Internet problems, you need to solve those before doing any kind of live streaming.

A connection problem can originate either from your ISP or your own setup. To rule out the ISP issues just check for any outages or maintenance works being done in the area (e.g. Comcast, Cox). Also - check to see if your ISP is throttling you.

Getting back to how to live stream concerts, here&apos;s what you do to fix slow and unreliable Internet on your side:

restart your modem / router, as well as your computer or mobile device you&apos;ll be streaming from.
move closer to the Wi-Fi router - or get that closer to your DJ setup.
use wired Ethernet instead of Wi-Fi, where available.
disconnect any other devices from your wireless router so you get all the upload bandwidth for live streaming your DJ set.
If all the above failed, check for an additional available Internet connection. Look in your pocket, for example - the cellular data from your smartphone.

Use  your home or concert venue Internet connection along with additional ones at the same time. You need a channel bonding service like Speedify for that.

Speedify Enables Hassle-Free Live Streaming of Virtual Concerts
Speedify is the only app that can combine multiple internet sources into one bonded super-connection for more stable and secure live streaming, video calling, and web browsing. As long as you&apos;re connected to more than one ISP, chances are you will not get disconnected completely from the Internet, thanks to Speedify&apos;s automatic failover protection. That way, you can live stream your concert without any problems.

Creating an Internet "super-pipe" that provides increased speed and reliability is especially important when:

live streaming - Speedify actually prioritizes live streams over other types of Internet traffic. So your Twitch, YouTube or other platforms you want to live stream your concert should be protected.
working remotely - you will stop getting pixelated video or buffering in video conferences, as well as being in touch with your colleagues in real time, not waiting for messages or attachments to go through.
online gaming - you will not lose the game because of an Internet glitch or be thrown out of the game because of laggy Internet.
More is better than one - that&apos;s why Speedify is the best solution to live stream concerts online.

        <h2>Internet Radio Device</h2>
        <p>An <dfn>Internet radio device</dfn>, also called network music player is a hardware device that is capable of receiving and playing streamed media from either Internet radio stations or a home network.</p>
        <p>The network music player is connected to a home router. For convenience a wireless router is often used. The router is connected to the internet and thus enables access to Internet streaming resources. Alternatively, the home network can access the user&apos;s collection of music on a computer or on a network-attached storage (NAS) device dedicated to store a user&apos;s music files.</p>
        <h4>Audio Streaming</h4>
        <p>Audio streaming is one way of transmitting audio files on a continuous feed to a network music player. A common way today is to stream the audio from the computer to a network music player over the more convenient wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi in a networked environment. The computer, which is typically used for storing the music file, acts as a music server by means of server software, often compliant to DLNA (Digital Living Network Alliance) standard. And the network music player is a typical receiver which starts playing an audio file as soon as some of the data has been received so that one does not have to wait for the entire audio file to finish downloading.</p>
        <p>The MP3 music file is streamed to the network music player in digital format, commonly in the original MP3 format. Therefore, the audio details of the MP3 music are sent wirelessly in the home to the network music player as it is stored on the computer and without loss.</p>
        <p>The MP3 music files are then converted back into audio signal by the network music player and played. As the MP3 music files are organized by the music server on the computer, the information is also sent to the network music player where the user can see all of the music track information. Many companies working actively in bringing Internet radio into devices are organized in the Internet Media Device Alliance IMDA. In addition to the home networking standards of DLNA, IMDA compatibility standards dedicated to all aspects of Internet radio distribution.</p>
