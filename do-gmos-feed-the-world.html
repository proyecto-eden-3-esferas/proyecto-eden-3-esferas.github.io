      <h1>Do GMOs Feed the World?</h1>
      <p>Most processed, conventional food in grocery stores is made using GMOs. Because GMOs are so prevalent in the food system, many people are surprised to learn that most GMOs aren&apos;t used to feed people.</p>
      <p>GMO crops such as corn, soy, cotton and alfalfa are grown on more than 200 million acres in the U.S. alone. More than half of the crops grown on that land end up in animal feed. Another 40 million acres-worth goes toward biofuels such as ethanol or biodiesel. The fraction that goes toward human consumption shows up as highly-processed, low-nutrient additives.</p>
      <p>GMOs are in our food, but they don&apos;t feed us and they certainly don&apos;t nourish us. In fact, most people on Earth, around 70%, rely on the expertise of small-scale farmers who operate outside of the industrial agriculture system favored in the industrial world.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>GMOs are an effective tool to increase the profit margin of massive agrochemical corporations. GMO crops and their growing systems often require excessive chemical inputs to ensure production, and the costs associated with growing GMOs can push farmers into debt. The vast monocultures where GMO flourish invite disease, pest infestations, and soil degradation for which the agrichemical industry offers even more accompanying chemical or fertilizer <q>solutions</q> (for a price).</p>
