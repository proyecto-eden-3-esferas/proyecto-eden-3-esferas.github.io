      <blockquote>Consistency, availability, and partition tolerance are the three major goals of distributed system design, and it is impossible to achieve all three at the same time.</blockquote>

      <h1>The CAP Theorem about Distributed Systems</h1>
      <p>CAP theorem, also known as Brewerâ€™s theorem, is a concept in computer science that states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Every read receives the most recent update or an error.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Every request receives a response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write.</li>
        <li><strong>Partition tolerance:</strong> The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes.</li>
      </ol>
