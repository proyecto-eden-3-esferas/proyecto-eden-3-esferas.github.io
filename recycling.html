      <h1>Recycling Waste: Upcycling or Downcycling?</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>recycling</dfn>, recovery and reprocessing of waste materials for use in new products. The basic phases in recycling are the collection of waste materials, their processing or manufacture into new products, and the purchase of those products, which may then themselves be recycled. Typical materials that are recycled include iron and steel scrap, aluminum cans, glass bottles, paper, wood, and plastics.</p>
        <p>The materials reused in recycling serve as substitutes for raw materials obtained from such increasingly scarce natural resources as petroleum, natural gas, coal, mineral ores, and trees.</p>
        <p>Recycling can help reduce the quantities of solid waste deposited in landfills, which have become increasingly expensive. Recycling also reduces the pollution of air, water, and land resulting from waste disposal.</p>

      <p>Most recycling involves converting or extracting useful materials from a product and creating a different product or material, either <a href="#upcycling">more</a> or <a href="#downcycling">less</a> valuable.</p>

      <section id="downcycling">
        <h2>Downcycling</h2>
        <p>Downcycling involves converting materials and products into new materials, sometimes of lesser quality.</p>
        <p>Material downcycling occurs when it is either not possible or uneconomic to restore materials to their original quality, for example, when wrought aluminium alloys are melted to produce lower-grade casting alloys. In such cases, material upcycling, in the thermodynamic sense, is only possible if even more energy is added to upgrade the material quality.</p>
        <p>Two guiding questions to ask when assessing recovering for waste materials or products are: How much energy is required to restore the recovered material back to the desired material or product?, and, How does this quantity compare with obtaining the desired material or product from virgin or primary sources? In some cases, little energy is                                                               required to reuse a discarded product, for example, secondhand clothing. In other cases, the energy required to recover the materials is more than the energy required to process virgin material.</p>

        <h2>Upcycling or Creative Reuse</h2>
        <p><dfn>Upcycling</dfn>, also known as <dfn>creative reuse</dfn>, is the process of transforming by-products, waste materials, useless, or unwanted products into new materials or products perceived to be of greater quality, such as artistic value or practical use.</p>
        <p>he goal of upcycling is to prevent wasting potentially useful materials by making use of existing ones. This reduces the consumption of new raw materials when creating new products. Reducing the use of new raw materials can result in a reduction of energy usage, air pollution, water pollution and even greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <p>Upcycling is the opposite of <a href="#downcycling">downcycling</a>, which is the other part of the recycling process.</p>

        <h2>Thornton Kay for Upcycling (and against Downcycling)</h2>
        <p>The terms <strong>upcycling</strong> and <strong>downcycling</strong> were first used in print in an article in <cite>SalvoNEWS</cite> by Thornton Kay quoting Reiner Pilz and published in 1994.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>We talked about the impending EU <cite>Demolition Waste Streams</cite> directive. <q>Recycling,</q> he said, <q>I call it <em>downcycling</em>. They smash bricks, they smash everything. What we need is <strong>upcycling</strong>, where old products are given more value, not less.</q> He despairs of the German situation and recalls the supply of a large quantity of reclaimed woodblock from an English supplier for a contract in Nuremberg, while just down the road a load of similar block was scrapped. In the road outside his premises was the result of the Germans&apos; demolition <q>waste</q> recycling. It was a pinky looking aggregate with pieces of handmade brick, old tiles, and discernible parts of useful old items mixed with crushed concrete. Is this the future for Europe?</p>
