      <h1>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</h1>

      <p>noun <strong>Linguistics</strong></p>
      <blockquote>a hypothesis, first advanced by Edward Sapir in 1929 and subsequently developed by Benjamin Whorf, that the structure of a language determines a native speaker's perception and categorization of experience.</blockquote>

      <hr/>

      <p>The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, also known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis, refers to the proposal that the particular language one speaks influences the way one thinks about reality.</p>

      <p></p>
      <p> Sapir was interested in charting the difference in language and cultural worldviews, including how language and culture influence each other. Whorf took this work on how language and culture shape each other a step further to explore how different languages might shape thought and behavior.</p>
      <p>Since then, the concept has evolved into multiple variations, some more credible than others.</p>
      <h2>Linguistic Determinism Is an Extreme Version of the Hypothesis</h2>
      <p><dfn>Linguistic determinism</dfn>, for example, is a more extreme version suggesting that a person&apos;s perception and thought are limited to the language they speak. An early example of linguistic determinism comes from Whorf himself who argued that the Hopi people in Arizona don&apos;t conjugate verbs into past, present, and future tenses as English speakers do and that their words for units of time (like <q>day</q> or <q>hour</q>) were verbs rather than nouns.</p>
      <p>From this, he concluded that the Hopi don&apos;t view time as a physical object that can be counted out in minutes and hours the way English speakers do. Instead, Whorf argued, the Hopi view time as a formless process.</p>
      <p>This was then taken by others to mean that the Hopi don&apos;t have any concept of time—an extreme view that has since been repeatedly disproven.</p>
