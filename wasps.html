      <h1>Wasps</h1>
      <p>The term <dfn>wasp</dfn> refers to any insect of the order Hymenoptera and suborder Apocrita, which is neither an ant or a bee. The most commonly known types of wasps are hornets and yellowjackets.</p>
      <p>In general, wasps avoid human activity and should only be considered a nuisance when nesting near homes or high traffic areas.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Wasps can be solitary or social, and there are even wasps that don&apos;t sting at all. The best way to prevent unpleasant encounters with social wasps is to avoid them. If you know where they are, try not to go near their nesting places.</p>
        <p>Wasps can become very defensive when their nest is disturbed due to their chemical communication. Wasps and bees release an alarm pheromone that marks their target and alerts the colony to attack. This can happen even when wasps are feeling threatened, not just when they sting or are injured, as some people believe. Wasps can present their stinger mid-air, releasing the alarm pheromone even from a casual swat.</p>
        <p>Wasps are so much more aggressive than bees because they are predatory and very protective of their young. They are particularly aggressive during the last months of summer.</p>
        <p>If you can&apos;t avoid wasps, try repelling them using a fake nest...</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Types of Wasps</h2>
        <p>Several types of wasps build paper nests that hang under eaves and from trees: the bald-faced hornet, yellowjacket, and paper wasp. All of these are social wasps, which can be aggressive and can sting you repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Bald-faced hornets are considered somewhat beneficial because they will control many pests and yellowjackets, but because they are so aggressive, it&apos;s not very nice to have them around. However, there are also the mud dauber and ichneumon wasps, which are solitary, almost never sting, and are beneficial predators.</p>
        <p>The differences between bees and wasps is not always immediately apparent because they are from the same order of insects. However, honey bees are hairy and sometimes have a few other color variations like brown or orange, while wasps are smooth and shiny and always black and yellow. Wasps live in smaller colonies than bees, and unlike bees, which have workers who build the hive, the wasp queen builds the nest. Wasps also hibernate during the winter and don&apos;t produce honey.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Beneficial Wasps</h3>
          <p>Beneficial wasps can be very effective pest control for the organic garden; they love flowers and contribute to pollination, though not as much as honeybees. The following types of wasps can be quite beneficial for controlling predators:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><i>Braconids</i>: small wasps that can control caterpillars and grubs</li>
            <li><i>Ichneumonids</i> and <i>pteromalids</i>: control caterpillars and beetle larvae</li>
            <li><i>Tiphiids</i>/<i>scoliids</i>: control Japanese beetles and June bugs</li>
            <li><i>Eulopids</i>: can control Colorado potato beetle</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>Preventing wasps from nesting around your home is your first line of defense against unpleasant wasp encounters.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Seal Entry Points</h3>
          <p>Solitary wasps in the home can be a nuisance; daily sightings of wasps in the home may indicate inside nest building, and more attention to the problem is required. Searching for and sealing off their point of entry is the best line of defense. Check your house for unsealed vents, torn screens, cracks around windows and door frames, and open dampers. Observe the flight path of a wasp, especially in the morning, which may reveal the entry/exit point.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Remove Food Sources</h3>
          <p>In spring and early summer, wasps are attracted to protein foods. Any food left outdoors, such as pet food, picnic scraps, open garbage containers, or uncovered compost piles should be removed or covered. Wasps imprint food sources and will continue to search an area for some time after the food has been removed.</p>
          <p>In late summer and early fall, wasps turn their attention to sweet foods. Their behavior is also more aggressive. Open cans of pop, fruit juice, fallen apples beneath fruit trees, and other sweet food sources will attract wasps. Be sure to cover drinks and open food containers, keep a lid on the compost, and avoid walking barefoot near fruit trees. Remove any fallen fruit rotting on the ground.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Avoid Swatting</h3>
          <p>Swatting and squashing wasps is counterproductive. When a wasp is squashed, a chemical (pheromone) is released which attracts and incites other nearby wasps. It&apos;s best to walk away from a hovering wasp.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Watch What You Wear</h3>
          <p>Avoid wearing bright colours or floral patterns. If you look like a big flower, you may be attracting the curious wasp looking for nectar.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Avoid Perfumes</h3>
          <p>In the later part of the summer, wasps are attracted to sweet smells. Minimize use of perfumes and other strong scents.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Use a Fake Nest</h3>
          <p>A fake nest will trick territorial wasps into believing that other wasps already live in the area. Most predatory wasps will avoid building a nest within a few hundred feet of another nest.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Use Herbs</h3>
          <p>Wasps don&apos;t like herbs that are very aromatic, especially spearmint, thyme, citronella, and eucalyptus. Plant some of these around your patio and outdoor sitting areas to repel wasps.</p>
          <dl>
            <!-- <varlistentry> -->
              <dt>Mint</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Mint is the best herb that repels all kinds of wasps and other buggers as well. Mint grows bets in pots because they growth is rapid when planted in the ground. You cannot remove the plant entirely once it is planted in a garden. The aromatic oils from mint can be combined with apple cider vinegar and witch hazel to create a perfect wasp repellent.</p>
              </dd>
            <!-- </varlistentry> -->
            <!-- <varlistentry> -->
              <dt>Wormwood</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>It is also known as Artemisia and is a shrub. It serves to be an excellent wasp deterrent plant and used for other insects as well. This plant has the tendency to grow in full shade. The wormwood leaves contain some absinthe which is water soluble and after rain wash off from the leaves and can kill other plants or flowers.</p>
              </dd>
            <!-- </varlistentry> -->
            <!-- <varlistentry> -->
              <dt>Lemongrass</dt>
              <dd>
                <p>Lemongrass also has a high tendency to repel wasps and other insects. During the summer season, citronella candles can be found in stores. Citronella oil comes from lemongrass. This plant can also serve well for ornamental purposes too as it can grow to four feet high and three feet wide in one season.</p>
