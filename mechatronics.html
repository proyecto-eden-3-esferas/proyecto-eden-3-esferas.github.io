      <h1>Mechatronics: Integrated Mechanical, Electrical, Control and Computer Engineering</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Mechatronics is an interdisciplinary engineering field that integrates mechanical, electrical, computer, and control engineering to create intelligent, automated systems. It is used to design products ranging from simple devices like microwaves and automatic transmissions to complex systems like robotics and medical imaging machines. The goal of mechatronics is to produce more efficient, streamlined, and synergistic products by unifying traditional design aspects.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics, electrical and electronics, hence the name being a portmanteau of the words <q>mechanics</q> and <q>electronics</q>; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas.</p>
