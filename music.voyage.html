      <h1>A8BA: <cite>Voyage</cite></h1>
      <p>ABBA Voyage is a virtual concert residency by the Swedish pop group ABBA. The concerts feature virtual avatars (dubbed <q>ABBAtars</q>), depicting the group as they appeared in 1979, and use vocals re-recorded by the group in a Swedish studio specifically for this show, accompanied by a 10 piece live instrumental band on stage. The concerts are held in ABBA Arena, a purpose-built venue in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London.</p>

      <p>The digital versions of ABBA were created with motion capture and performance techniques with the four band members and the visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, the project is one of the most expensive live music experiences in history, with a budget of $175 million.</p>

        <h2>ABBAtar technology</h2>
        <p>The ABBAtars are rendered via computer-generated imagery, courtesy of visual effects company Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM). On-stage, an LED display shows the band in scale, as it would appear if performers really were there, and in the monitors to the sides of the stage the image is fully computer-generated. As the audience is more likely to look at the screens than the stage itself, where for many the band would be too small to make out at a distance, the illusion is maintained.</p>
        <p>The ABBA band members wore motion-capture suits as part of the development process and were filmed as they performed a 22-song set over the course of five weeks. Some 160 cameras were used. The choreography is based on the band members&apos; real movements, but captured from younger body doubles. The digital band, using the songs&apos; originally-recorded vocals, are accompanied by a live instrumental band on stage. Andersson stated that ILM <q>can do the work if we wanted to swap a couple of songs in a year&apos;s time or so and work on it and it&apos;ll be exactly the same. We don&apos;t have to go back ourselves into the studio again. That&apos;s what they have promised us</q>.</p>
        <p>The body doubles are/were:</p>
