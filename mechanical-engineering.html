        <p><dfn>Mechanical engineering</dfn> is a broad engineering discipline that applies principles of physics and mathematics to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It involves creating and improving anything that moves, from tiny sensors to large-scale machinery, and is a crucial field for industries like aerospace, automotive, energy, and robotics. Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of subjects like mechanics, thermodynamics, and materials science to ensure designs are safe, efficient, and cost-effective</p>

        <h2>Gears</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://fractory.com/types-of-gears/">https://fractory.com/types-of-gears/</a></cite>)</p>
        <p><dfn>Gears</dfn> are rotating machine elements that transmit torque from one shaft to another via the teeth machined into them. Gears with similar tooth profiles mesh. This allows transmitting the power from a driving shaft to a driven one.</p>
        <p>Different gear types are used in machines as they can be designed for a range of forces from a range of materials. They can also be used to increase/decrease rotational velocity as well as change the direction of rotation.</p>
        <p>Gears can also be used to pump liquids as in the case of gear pumps for fuel oil and lubrication oil for instance. They mesh so well (forming a positive displacement pump) that the liquid is pushed ahead with high delivery pressures.</p>
        <p>They are also used in <strong>chain blocks</strong> to lift heavy objects easily. Thus, gears are a core component of most equipment as they are quite versatile and able to perform a variety of tasks.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>The Shape of Gear Teeth</h3>
          <p>Most modern gear teeth have an <dfn>involute curve</dfn> shape, which is formed by unwinding a taut string from a cylinder or drum. This shape ensures smooth contact between teeth, allowing for efficient and constant-velocity power transmission. Other profiles like <strong>cycloidal</strong> and <strong>trochoid</strong> exist, but the involute is the most common.</p>
          <section id="involute">
            <h4>Involute Curve</h4>
            <p>The <dfn>involute curve</dfn> specific geometry allows the contact point between teeth to slide smoothly along a straight line, providing a constant velocity ratio and transferring torque without vibration.</p>
            <p>Morevoer, it provides a consistent velocity ratio even if the center distance between the gears varies slightly, which is a significant advantage in real-world applications.</p>
