      <h1>Linux Distributions</h1>
      <p>A linux <dfn>distribution</dfn>, short for <q>software distribution</q>, or just <q>distro</q>, is a software bundle wherefrom you make a Linux installation. A distribution must contain the bare operating system with a Linux kernel (the <q>engine</q> or orchestrator, so to speak), plus lots of <dfn>packages</dfn> or files that can each add a matching application. For instance a file named <code>fbreader.deb</code> might the used to intall the FBReader app on a Debian system. Additionally, for each distribution a standard or official source of packages is provided so that for most applications no hacking is required.</p>
      <p>Most Linux software distributions are derived from one of a few branches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Debian: Debian, Ubuntu, Mint...</li>
        <li>Slackware: Porteus</li>
        <li>RedHat: Fedora</li>
        <li>SuSE: openSuSe</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Lubuntu</h2>
        <p>The project&apos;s goal is to provide a lightweight yet functional Linux distribution based on a rock-solid Ubuntu base. Lubuntu provides a simple but modern and powerful graphical user interface, and comes with a wide variety of applications so you can browse, email, chat, play, and be productive. Lubuntu was formerly a distribution for low-end hardware.</p>

        <h2>LXLE</h2>
        <p>LXLE is based on Lubuntu which is an Ubuntu OS using the LXDE desktop environment. It is designed to be a drop-in and go OS, primarily for aging computers. Its intention is to be able to install it on any computer and be relatively done after install. At times removing unwanted programs or features is easier than configuring for a day. Our distro follows the same LTS schedule as Ubuntu. In short, LXLE is an eclectic respin of Lubuntu with its own user support.</p>
        <h4 class="bridgehead">What is a Respin?</h4>
        <p>A respin is a remastered version of a major Linux distro tailored for a specific purpose or group.</p>
        <h4 class="bridgehead">OS Philosophy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Stick with LTS only releases of Ubuntu to ensure hardware &amp; software support.</li>
          <li>Based on Lubuntu Linux to ensure a fast capable desktop for aging computers.</li>
          <li>Keep desktop and other major software updated to the latest stable version.</li>
          <li>Provide a complete drop in and go replacement for XP, Vista, 7 Starter/Basic.</li>
          <li>Cover most users everyday needs by providing an excellent set of default apps.</li>
          <li>Add useful necessary mods and tweaks, to improve performance &amp; functions.</li>
          <li>Develop a beautiful modern looking intuitive desktop for anyone to use easily.</li>
          <li>Save system resources and spend them wisely on capable, feature rich apps.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Porteus</h2>
        <p>Porteus is a complete linux operating system that is optimized to run from CD, USB flash drive, hard drive, or other bootable storage media. It's small (under 300Mb) and insanely fast which allows you to start up and get online while most other operating systems are left spitting dust. Porteus comes in both 32 &amp; 64 bit and aims to keep on the bleeding edge. It also supports several different languages and the user forum has language sections.</p>
