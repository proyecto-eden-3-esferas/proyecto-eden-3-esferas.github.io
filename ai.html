        <h2>Symbolic AI</h2>
        <p>From the 1950s to the 1990s, the dominant paradigm  in AI research was symbolic  (or <q>classical</q> or <q>logical</q>) AI. This approach to AI was based on logical reasoning, using symbols and rules—written by human programmers—to represent concepts and the relationships between them. Classical AI had many successes, including AIs that could play games, hold basic conversations, and answer queries using <q>expert systems.</q> Although statistical AI has since overtaken classical AI, the old approach has not been entirely abandoned; many of its techniques have been incorporated into modern AI applications, such as natural language processing and robotics.</p>
        <p>In AI, a <dfn>symbol</dfn> is a representation  of a real-world item or concept—a simple type of symbol is a picture. A symbol can also be a group  of other symbols, such as the letters that make  up the name of an object. In symbolic AI, symbols embody the total sum of the relevant facts and information required for the system to understand what something is. To achieve this, data is labeled and attached to a symbol.</p>
        <p>AIs are programmed to follow strictly logical rules, with the aim of producing reliable conclusions. One such rule is the syllogism, which states: <q>If all <var>A</var>s are <var>B</var>s and all <var>B</var>s are <var>C</var>s, then all <var>A</var>s are <var>C</var>s.</q> This simple principle enables AIs to know that all items  of a particular class will always have a particular characteristic.</p>

      <section id="rule-based">
        <h2>Rule-Based Systems</h2>
        <p>A rule-based AI system uses instructions, consisting of <code>IF-THEN</code> statements, to draw conclusions based on an initial set of facts. In its simplest form, an IF-THEN statement says to the system:  <q>If this condition is true for the current facts, then do this; if it  is false, do nothing.</q> Adding an <code>ELSE</code> option allows for more complicated statements: <q>If this is true, then do this; otherwise (else), do that.</q></p>
        <p>Rule-based systems are predictable, reliable, and <q>transparent,</q> meaning it is easy to see which rules the AI applies. However, rule-based AIs cannot <q>learn</q> by adding to their store  of rules and facts without human intervention.</p>

        <h2>Heuristics</h2>
        <p>Some problems can be too complex for an algorithm to solve quickly. In such cases, all an AI can do is a <dfn>brute-force search</dfn>, which means to methodically work through and evaluate every possible solution. This is slow, however, and in some cases impossible.</p>
        <p>A more efficient alternative is to use a <dfn>heuristic</dfn>. This practical method uses a common-sense approach, searching for an approximate solution by estimating a <q>good enough</q> choice at every decision point based on the information available.</p>
