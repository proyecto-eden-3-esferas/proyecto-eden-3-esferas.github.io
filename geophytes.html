      <h1>Geophytes</h1>
      <p><dfn>Geophytes</dfn> are plants typically with underground storage organs, where the plants hold energy and water. A broad synonym for a geophyte is bulb, but they are far more diverse than that: Geophytes also include plants with tubers, corms or rhizomes. Many different kinds of plants have evolved these underground structures, and not all geophytes are related to one another. Some common geophytes include vegetables like <a target="_blank" href="grow-carrots.html">carrots</a>, ginger and garlic and flowers such as daffodils and hyacinths.</p>
      <aside>he word <q>geophyte</q> was created as part of a plant classification system based on the location of dormant buds in relation to growth habit and location relative to the ground (i.e. above or below the soil level or water). The system, called the Raunkiær Plant Life-Forms classification system, was created by Christen C. Raunkiær, a Danish botanist, in 1904.</aside>
      <p>The geophyte&apos;s underground storage organ helps protect its valuable nutrients and water it holds inside. It also shelters its buds in the soil to protect them from environmental factors like heat, cold, fire, drought and animals.  One study showed geophytes live in drier, cooler and more variable climates than non-geophytes.</p>
      <p>The energy geophytes store is generally in the form of carbohydrates, which is one reason these plants are so tasty.</p>

      <hr/>

      <p>Geophytes may be further subdivided into rhizome, stem-tuber, root-tuber, bulb and root geophytes.</p>
