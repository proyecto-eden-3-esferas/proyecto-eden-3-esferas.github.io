      <h1>Millet</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>https://www.britannica.com/plant/millet-plant</cite>)</p>
      <p><dfn>millet</dfn>, any of several species of cereal grasses in the family Poaceae, cultivated for their small edible seeds. Millets were cultivated in Asia and Africa more than 4,000 years ago, and they were major grains in Europe during the Middle Ages. Although they are used chiefly for pasture or to produce hay in the United States and western Europe, they remain important food staples in developing countries worldwide. Given their hardiness, millets have been advocated as a tool to combat food insecurity in areas susceptible to changing temperature and rainfall regimes, particularly India and sub-Saharan Africa. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization named 2023 “the year of the millets” in recognition of their importance in the global food supply.</p>
      <p>Millet grains are high in carbohydrates, their protein content varying from 6 to 11 percent and fat varying from 1.5 to 5 percent. They are somewhat strong in taste and are mainly consumed in flatbreads and porridges or prepared and eaten much like rice.</p>

        <h2>Physical description</h2>
        <p>Millets are typically grown as annuals and range in height from 30 to 130 cm (1 to 4 feet), with the exception of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), which has stalks 1.5 to 3 metres (5 to 10 feet) tall and about 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick. The inflorescences may be spikes or racemes, in which the flowers are borne on stalks of about equal length along an elongated axis, or panicles with dense clusters of small florets. With the exception of pearl millet, seeds remain enclosed in hulls after threshing. Hulled seeds are usually creamy white.</p>
        <p>Compared with other grains, millets are generally are more tolerant of poor soils and drought. They can withstand a range of harsh growing conditions and often need fewer inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. In addition, some deep-rooted varieties can reduce erosion and help mitigate desertification.</p>

        <h2>Types</h2>
        <p>Pearl millet, called bajra in India, is suited to soils of low fertility and limited moisture and is a popular food crop in India and Africa. Little millet (<i lang="la">Panicum sumatrense</i>) is also chiefly a food crop of India.</p>
        <p>Proso millet—also called common, or broomcorn, millet (<i lang="la">Panicum miliaceum</i>)—ripens within 60–80 days after sowing and is commonly used in birdseed mixtures. It is also eaten as a cereal food in Asia and eastern Europe and is used as a livestock feed elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Foxtail millet (<i lang="la">Setaria italica</i>) has small pointed seeds. It is grown for hay in North America and western Europe, and it is an important food crop in China and other Asian countries. Finger millet (<i lang="la">Eleusine coracana</i>) is an important food grain in southern Asia and parts of Africa. Japanese millet (<i lang="la">Echinochloa frumentacea</i>) is grown chiefly in Japan and the United States as a hay crop.</p>
