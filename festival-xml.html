      <h1>Festival XML Mark-UP</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite><a href="http://www.festvox.org/docs/manual-2.4.0/festival_10.html#XML_002fSGML-mark_002dup">XML/SGML mark-up</a></cite>)</p>

      <p>The ideas of a general, synthesizer system nonspecific, mark-up language for labelling text has been under discussion for some time. Festival has supported an SGML based markup language through multiple versions most recently STML (sproat97). This is based on the earlier SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) which was supported by previous versions of Festival (taylor96). With this version of Festival we support Sable a similar mark-up language devised by a consortium from Bell Labls, Sub Microsystems, AT&amp;T and Edinburgh, sable98. Unlike the previous versions, which were SGML based, the implementation of Sable in Festival is now XML based. To the user they different is negligable but using XML makes processing of files easier and more standardized. Also Festival now includes an XML, parser thus reducing the dependencies in processing Sable text.</p>

      <p>Raw text has the problem that it cannot always easily be rendered as speech in the way the author wishes. Sable offers a well-defined way of marking up text so that the synthesizer may render it appropriately.</p>
      <p>The definition of Sable is by no means settled and is still in development. In this release Festival offers people working on Sable and other XML (and SGML) based markup languages a chance to quickly experiment with prototypes by providing a DTD (document type descriptions) and the mapping of the elements in the DTD to Festival functions. Although we have not yet (personally) investigated facilities like cascading style sheets and generalized SGML specification languages like DSSSL, we believe the facilities offer by Festival allow rapid prototyping of speech output markup languages.</p>
      <p>Primarily we see Sable markup text as a language that will be generated by other programs, e.g. text generation systems, dialog managers etc. therefore a standard, easy to parse, format is required, even if it seems overly verbose for human writers.</p>
