      <h1>Landrace Gardening (Joseph Lofthouse)</h1>
      <p>A landrace is a genetically-diverse, promiscuously-pollinating, and locally-adapted crop. Landraces are loved for producing stable yields under changing growing conditions.</p>

      <p>Landrace crops arise by survival of the fittest and farmer preference for reliability in tough conditions. Plants that don&apos;t survive long enough to make seeds die out. The strongest plants survive. The arrival of new pests, new diseases, or changes in cultural practices, or in the environment may harm some individuals in a landrace population. With the high diversity many plant families do well, regardless of changing conditions.</p>

      <p>Landrace crops frequently grow under subsistence level conditions without costly inputs such as herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers, or weeding. For gardens with extreme growing conditions or pests, landrace crops may provide the only reliable harvests.<!-- The premise of this book is that growing food, saving seeds, and plant breeding are the common inheritance of humanity. Illiterate plant breeders brought us every crop that we now grow. The seedkeepers didn&apos;t read or write. They didn&apos;t know about genes. Without book-learning, they collaborated cooperatively with each other and with the plants and ecosystem to bring us wonderful crops.--></p>

      <hr/>

      <p>Crops grew as landraces since time immemorial, except during recent decades, when growing food was ceded to mega corporations.</p>
      <p>About 60 years ago, an industrial model of growing food began to separate people from traditional food production methods. Far away <q>experts</q> replaced people&apos;s own understanding and insight. People generally stopped growing their own food and seeds, and became cogs in a global corporate machine. The separation is pervasive.</p>
