      <h1>Types of Integrated Circuits</h1>
      <p>ICs can be classified into different types based on their complexity and purpose. Some common types of ICs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><dfn>Digital ICs</dfn>: These are used in devices such as computers and microprocessors. Digital ICs can be used for memory, storing data, or logic. They are economical and easy to design for low-frequency applications.</li>
        <li><dfn>Analog ICs</dfn>: Analog ICs are designed to process continuous signals in which the signal magnitude varies from zero to full supply voltage. These ICs are used to process analog signals such as sound or light. In comparison to digital ICs, they are made of fewer transistors but are more difficult to design. Analog ICs can be used in a wide range of applications, including amplifiers, filters, oscillators, voltage regulators, and power management circuits. They are commonly found in electronic devices such as audio equipment, radio frequency (RF) transceivers, communications, sensors, and medical instruments.</li>
        <li><dfn>Mixed-signal ICs</dfn>: Combining both digital and analog circuits, mixed-signal ICs are used in areas where both types of processing are required, such as screen, sensor, and communications applications in mobile phones, cars, and portable electronics.</li>
        <li><dfn>Memory ICs</dfn>: These ICs are used store data both temporarily or permanently. Examples of memory ICs include random access memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). Memory ICs are among the largest ICs in terms of transistor count and require extremely high-capacity and fast simulation tools.</li>
        <li><dfn>Application-Specific Integrated Circuit</dfn> (ASIC): ASICs are designed to perform a particular task efficiently. It is not a general-purpose IC that can be implemented in most applications but is instead a system-on-chip (SoC) customized to execute a targeted function.</li>
      </ul>
