      <h1>Programming Computers</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Programming is the ability to instruct a machine to perform step by step tasks in such a way that it solves a problem. We put a machine in charge of this because even if the initial problem itself may seem too complex for a machine to solve, the individual steps are not too complex and can be solved by a machine, faster and easier than by a human. This process takes care of the easily predictible and repetitive tasks so that the human can focus on the less easy predictable and more complex tasks. After all, the human understands the whole picture and what those separate steps amount to; the machine does not.</p>

          <h2>Early History Programming Languages</h2>
          <p>(From <a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/insider-membership-news/timeline-of-programming-languages">Coding From 1849 to 2022: a Guide to The Timeline of Programming Languages</a>, by Severine Hierso, published 06/10/2022)</p>
        </header>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1957 Fortran</h4>
        <p>John Backus created FORmula TRANslation or <dfn>FORTRAN</dfn> back in 1957. Incredibly, this programming language from the 1950s is still used today in supercomputers and scientific and mathematical computations.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1958 ALGOL and LISP</h4>
        <p>An algorithmic language created by American and European scientists, ALGOL became the point of origin for world-renowned programming languages such as Pascal, Java, C, and C++.</p>
        <p>In the same year, John McCarthy invented the List Processor or <a href="lisp.html">LISP</a>. Intended for <a href="ai.html">AI</a>, companies like Boeing and Genworks are still using it.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1959 COBOL</h4>
        <p><dfn>COBOL</dfn> was developed by a team led by Dr. Grace Murray Hopper; COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It was designed for credit card transaction processors, traffic signals, and phone calls, and today is used in banking and gaming. Today&apos;s virtual PBX system and other modern solutions to communication rest on the shoulders of programming languages like COBOL.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1970 PASCAL</h4>
        <p>Niklaus Wirth developed <dfn>PASCAL</dfn> and named it after Blaise Pascal, the French mathematician. So easy to learn, it was used by Apple early on in its history.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1972 Smalltalk, C, and SQL</h4>
        <p>Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and Dan Ingalls developed <dfn>Smalltalk</dfn> at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre. It was designed to modify code. Its principles are present in today&apos;s Java, Python, and Ruby and are used by companies like CrowdStrike and Logitech.</p>
        <p><dfn>C</dfn> was also developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. It was designed to be used with the Unix operating system. Based on its forerunner B, languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, and Python are all derived from C.</p>
        <p>In what could be called a vintage year for coding and programming languages, Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlain developed <a href="sql.html" target="_blank">SQL</a> (Structured Query Language) the same year. It was first called SEQUEL, and it was used for viewing and altering information in databases.</p>
        <p>These three languages represent a significant leap forward in programming, which has impacted some of the largest tech companies in existence today. Our whole way of using the digital world, from social media to how a business&apos;s lead referral program functions, owes a debt to these developments.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1980s ADA</h4>
        <p>Named after Ada Lovelace, the computing pioneer, <dfn>ADA</dfn> was designed by Jean Ichbiah&apos;s team at CUU Honeywell Bull. Ada is a high-level programming language, extended from other popular programming languages such as Pascal. ADA is used for air-traffic control in various European countries and space programs.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1983 C++, Objective C</h4>
        <p>Bjarne Stroustrup modified the C language at Bell Labs. The result was <a href="cpp.html">C++</a>, which had some augmentations such as <a href="oop.classes.html">classes</a> and other OOP features, templates, etc. C++ is now used in MS Office, Adobe Photoshop, and various types of high-performance software.</p>
        <p>Brad Cox and Tom Love then developed <dfn>Objective-C</dfn>, the programming language used for Apple&apos;s operating systems.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1987 Perl</h4>
        <p>Larry Wall developed PERL as a general-purpose, high-level language. He designed it for text editing, but today its primary use is in database applications, data processing, graphic programming, and system administration.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1990 Haskell</h4>
        <p>Named after the American mathematician Haskell Brooks Curry. Haskell is a primarily mathematical programming language. Used in various industries that need to make complicated calculations, crunch numbers, and keep records.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1991 Python and Visual Basic</h4>
        <p>The iconic British comedy act Monty Python inspired <dfn>Python</dfn>&apos;s name. Guido Van Rossum developed this general-purpose, high-level language. Today Python is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Giants like Google and Spotify use it.</p>
        <p><dfn>Visual Basic</dfn> allows a user to drag and drop sections of code via a user interface (GUI). Parts of Visual Basic are used in applications like Word and Excel.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1993 Ruby</h4>
        <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto created <dfn>Ruby</dfn> as a high-level programming language. Used for web applications development, today it&apos;s used by Groupon.</p>

        <h4 class="bridgehead">1995 Java, JavaScript, PHP</h4>
        <p>Created by James Gosling in 1995, <dfn>Java</dfn> is one of the world&apos;s most famous and popular programming languages. It&apos;s a general-purpose, high-level language used in cell phones and parking machines.</p>
        <p><a href="js.html" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> was created by Brendan Eich. Used for web development, PDF documents, and desktop widgets, it&apos;s on almost every major website. Some famous examples are Adobe, Gmail, and Mozilla Firefox.</p>
        <p><dfn>PHP</dfn> was known as <q>Personal Home Page</q> but now stands for <q>Hypertext Preprocessor</q>. It was developed by Rasmus Lerdorf. It&apos;s used for building and maintaining <a href="TheWeb.html" target="_blank">web</a> pages and server-side development. Huge companies like Facebook, Wikipedia, and WordPress use PHP.</p>
