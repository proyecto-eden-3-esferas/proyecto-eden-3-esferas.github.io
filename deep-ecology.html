      <h1>Deep Ecology</h1>
      <!-- from 45458 to 45551 -->
      <p>In 1973, Norwegian philosopher and mountaineer Arne Naess introduced the phrase <dfn class="firstterm">deep ecology</dfn> to environmental literature. Environmentalism had emerged as a popular grassroots political movement in the 1960s with the publication of Rachel Carson's book <a target="_blank" href="environmentalism.html#silent-spring">Silent Spring</a>. Those already involved in conservation and preservation efforts were now joined by many others concerned about the detrimental environmental effects of modern industrial technology. The longer-range, older originators of the movement included writers and activists like Henry David Thoreau, John Muir and Aldo Leopold; more mainstream awareness was closer to the <q>wise-use</q> conservation philosophy pioneered by Gifford Pinchot.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Two Different Forms of Environmentalism</h2>
        <p>In 1972, Naess made a presentation in Bucharest at the Third World Future Research Conference. In his talk, he discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its concern with an ethic respecting nature and the inherent worth of other beings. As a mountaineer who had climbed all over the world, Naess had enjoyed the opportunity to observe political and social activism in diverse cultures. Both historically and in the contemporary movement, Naess saw two different forms of environmentalism, not necessarily incompatible with each other. One he called the <q>long-range deep ecology movement</q> and the other, the <q>shallow ecology movement</q>. The word <em class="wordasword">deep</em> in part referred to the level of questioning of our purposes and values when arguing in environmental conflicts. The <q>deep</q> movement involves deep questioning, right down to fundamental root causes. The short-term, shallow approach stops before the ultimate level of fundamental change, often promoting technological fixes (e.g. recycling, increased automotive efficiency, export-driven monocultural organic agriculture) based on the same consumption-oriented values and methods of the industrial economy. The long-range deep approach involves redesigning our whole systems based on values and methods that truly preserve the ecological and cultural diversity of natural systems.</p>
        <p>The distinguishing and original characteristics of the deep ecology movement were its recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies. Those who work for social changes based on this recognition are motivated by love of nature as well as for humans. They recognize that we cannot go on with industrialism's <q>business as usual.</q> Without changes in basic values and practices, we will destroy the diversity and beauty of the world, and its ability to support diverse human cultures.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Eight Principles in the Deep Ecology Platform</h2>
        <p>In order to establish shared objectives, Naess proposed a set of eight principles to characterize the deep ecology movement as part of the general ecology movement. The platform can be endorsed by people from a diversity of religious and philosophical backgrounds as well as differing political affiliations. <q>Supporters of the deep ecology movement</q> (rather than being referred to as <q>deep ecologists</q>) are united by a long-range vision of what is necessary to protect the integrity of the Earth's ecological communities and ecocentric values.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="deep_ecology_principles">
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_1">The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have <em>value</em> in themselves (synonyms: inherent worth, intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_2">Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_3">Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_4">Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_5">The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_6">Policies must therefore be changed. The changes in policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_7">The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent worth) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.</dd>
          <dd id="deep_ecology_principle_8">Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the necessary changes.</dd>
        </ul>
        <p>If we do not accept the industrial development model, what then? Endorsing the Deep Ecology Platform principles leads us to attend to the <dfn class="firstterm">ecosophies</dfn> of aboriginal and indigenous people so as to learn from them values and practices that can help us to dwell wisely in the many different places in this world. We learn from the wisdom of our places and the many beings who inhabit them. At the same time, the ecocentric values implied by the platform lead us to recognize that all human cultures have a mutual interest in seeing Earth and its diversity continue for its own sake and because most of us love it. We want to flourish and realize ourselves in harmony with other beings and cultures. Is it possible to develop common understandings that enable us to work with civility toward harmony with other creatures and beings? The Deep Ecology Platform principles are a step in this direction. Respect for diversity leads us to recognize the ecological wisdom that grows specific to place and context. Thus, supporters of the deep ecology movement emphasize place-specific, ecological wisdom, and vernacular technology practices. No one philosophy and technology is applicable to the whole planet. As Naess has said many times, the more diversity, the better.</p>

        <h2>Alternatives to the Industrial Development Model</h2>
        <p>Accepting the Deep Ecology Platform principles entails a commitment to respecting the intrinsic values of richness and diversity. This, in turn, leads one to critique <a target="_blank" href="industrial-farming.html">industrial culture</a>, whose development models construe the Earth only as raw materials to be used to satisfy consumption and production&#x2014;to meet not only vital needs but inflated desires whose satisfaction requires more and more consumption. While industrial culture has represented itself as the only acceptable model for development, its monocultures destroy cultural and biological diversity in the name of human convenience and profit.</p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p><q>Deep ecology</q> was born in Scandinavia, the result of discussions between N&#xE6;ss and his colleagues Sigmund Kval&#xF8;y and Nils Faarlund (see N&#xE6;ss 1973 and 1989; also see Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999 for a historical survey and commentary on the development of deep ecology). All three shared a passion for the great mountains. On a visit to the Himalayas, they became impressed with aspects of Sherpa culture particularly when they found that their Sherpa guides regarded certain mountains as sacred and accordingly would not venture onto them. Subsequently, N&#xE6;ss formulated a position which <em>extended</em> the reverence the three Norwegians and the Sherpas felt for mountains to other natural things in general.</p>
        <p>The <q>shallow ecology movement</q>, as N&#xE6;ss (1973) calls it, is the <q>fight against pollution and resource depletion</q>, the central objective of which is <q>the health and affluence of people in the developed countries.</q> The <q>deep ecology movement</q>, in contrast, endorses <q>biospheric egalitarianism</q>, the view that all living things are alike in having value in their own right, independent of their usefulness to others. The deep ecologist respects this intrinsic value, taking care, for example, when walking on the mountainside not to cause unnecessary damage to the plants.</p>
        <p>Inspired by Spinoza's metaphysics, another key feature of N&#xE6;ss's deep ecology is the rejection of <dfn class="firstterm">atomistic individualism</dfn>. The idea that a human being is such an individual possessing a separate essence, N&#xE6;ss argues, radically separates the human self from the rest of the world. To make such a separation not only leads to selfishness towards other people, but also induces human selfishness towards nature. As a counter to egoism at both the individual and species level, N&#xE6;ss proposes the adoption of an alternative relational <q>total-field image</q> of the world. According to this relationalism, organisms (human or otherwise) are best understood as <q>knots</q> in the biospherical net. The identity of a living thing is essentially constituted by its relations to other things in the world, especially its ecological relations to other living things. If people conceptualise themselves and the world in relational terms, the deep ecologists argue, then people will take better care of nature and the world in general.</p>
        <p>As developed by N&#xE6;ss and others, the position also came to focus on the possibility of the identification of the human <a href="ego.en.html">ego</a> with nature. The idea is, briefly, that by identifying with nature I can enlarge the boundaries of the self beyond my skin. My larger&#x2014;ecological&#x2014;Self (the capital <q>S</q> emphasizes that I am something larger than my body and consciousness), deserves respect as well. To respect and to care for my Self is also to respect and to care for the natural environment, which is actually part of me and with which I should identify. <dfn>Self-realization</dfn>, in other words, is the reconnection of the shriveled human individual with the wider natural environment. N&#xE6;ss maintains that the deep satisfaction that we receive from identification with nature and close partnership with other forms of life in nature contributes significantly to our life quality. (One clear historical antecedent to this kind of nature spiritualism is the romanticism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau as expressed in his last work, the <cite class="book">Reveries of the Solitary Walker</cite>)</p>
        <p>When N&#xE6;ss's view crossed the Atlantic, it was sometimes merged with ideas emerging from Leopold's land ethic (see Devall and Sessions 1985; also see Sessions (ed) 1995). But N&#xE6;ss&#x2014;wary of the apparent totalitarian political implications of Leopold's position that individual interests and well-being should be subordinated to the holistic good of the earth's biotic community &#x2014;has always taken care to distance himself from advocating any sort of <q>land ethic</q>. (See Anker 1999 for cautions on interpreting N&#xE6;ss's relationalism as an endorsement of the kind of holism displayed in the land ethic; cf. Grey 1993, Taylor and Zimmerman 2005). Some critics have argued that N&#xE6;ss's deep ecology is no more than an extended social-democratic version of utilitarianism, which counts human interests in the same calculation alongside the interests of all natural things (e.g., trees, wolves, bears, rivers, forests and mountains) in the natural environment (see Witoszek 1997). However, N&#xE6;ss failed to explain in any detail how to make sense of the idea that oysters or barnacles, termites or bacteria could have interests of any morally relevant sort at all. Without an account of this, N&#xE6;ss's early <q>biospheric egalitarianism</q>&#x2014;that all living things whatsoever had a similar right to live and flourish&#x2014;was an indeterminate principle in practical terms. It also remains unclear in what sense rivers, mountains and forests can be regarded as possessors of any kind of interests. This is an issue on which N&#xE6;ss always remained elusive.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Ecosophy T</h2>
        <p>Biospheric egalitarianism was modified in the 1980s to the weaker claim that the flourishing of both human and non-human life have value in themselves. At the same time, N&#xE6;ss declared that his own favoured ecological philosophy&#x2014;<dfn class="firstterm">Ecosophy T</dfn>, as he called it after his Tvergastein mountain cabin&#x2014;was only one of several possible foundations for an environmental ethic. Deep ecology ceased to be a specific doctrine, but instead became a <q>platform</q>, of eight simple points, on which N&#xE6;ss hoped all deep green thinkers could agree. The platform was conceived as establishing a middle ground, between underlying philosophical orientations, whether Christian, Buddhist, Daoist, process philosophy, or whatever, and the practical principles for action in specific situations, principles generated from the underlying philosophies. Thus the deep ecological movement became explicitly pluralist .</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Criticism</h2>
        <p>While N&#xE6;ss's Ecosophy T sees human Self-realization as a solution to the environmental crises resulting from human selfishness and exploitation of nature, some of the followers of the deep ecology platform in the United States and Australia further argue that the expansion of the human self to include non-human nature is supported by the <a href="quantum-theory.html#copenhagen-interpretation">Copenhagen interpretation</a> of quantum theory, which is said to have dissolved the boundaries between the observer and the observed (see Fox 1984, 1990, and Devall and Sessions 1985; cf. Callicott 1985). These <q>relationalist</q> developments of deep ecology are, however, criticized by some feminist theorists. The idea of nature as part of oneself, one might argue, could justify the continued exploitation of nature instead. For one is presumably more entitled to treat oneself in whatever ways one likes than to treat another independent agent in whatever ways one likes. According to some feminist critics, the deep ecological theory of the <q>expanded self</q> is in effect a disguised form of human colonialism, unable to give nature its due as a genuine <q>other</q> independent of human interest and purposes (see Plumwood 1993, Ch. 7, 1999, and Warren 1999).</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some third-world critics accused deep ecology of being elitist in its attempts to preserve wilderness experiences for only a select group of economically and socio-politically well-off people. The Indian writer Ramachandra Guha (1989, 1999) for instance, depicts the activities of many western-based conservation groups as a new form of cultural imperialism, aimed at securing converts to conservationism (cf. Bookchin 1987 and Brennan 1998a). <q>Green missionaries</q>, as Guha calls them, represent a movement aimed at further dispossessing the world's poor and indigenous people. <q>Putting deep ecology in its place,</q> he writes, <q>is to recognize that the trends it derides as 'shallow' ecology might in fact be varieties of environmentalism that are more apposite, more representative and more popular in the countries of the South.</q> Although N&#xE6;ss himself repudiates suggestions that deep ecology is committed to any imperialism (see Witoszek and Brennan (eds.) 1999, Ch. 36&#x2013;7 and 41), Guha's criticism raises important questions about the application of deep ecological principles in different social, economic and cultural contexts. Finally, in other critiques, deep ecology is portrayed as having an inconsistent utopian vision (see Anker and Witoszek 1998).</p>
