      <h1>Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in C++</h1>
      <p>Relative to other object-oriented languages, C++ is very compile-time oriented. Overriding member functions works because of a level of indirection between a member function and its implementation, not because the object has built-in knowledge of its own class.</p>
      <p>There are, however, features in C++ that provide a run-time view of an object. These features are commonly grouped together under a feature set called <dfn>run-time type information (RTTI)</dfn>. RTTI provides a number of useful features for working with information about an object&apos;s class membership. One such feature is <code>dynamic_cast()</code>, which allows you to safely convert between types within an object-oriented hierarchy. Using dynamic_cast() on a class without a vtable, that is, without any virtual member functions, causes a compilation error.</p>
      <p>A second RTTI feature is the <code>typeid</code> operator, which lets you query for types at run time. The result of applying the operator is a reference to an <code class="classname">std::type_info</code> object, defined in <cite>&lt;typeinfo&gt;</cite>. The type_info class has a member function called <code>name()</code> returning the compiler-dependent name of the type. The <code>typeid</code> operator behaves as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>typeid(<var>type</var>):</code> Results in a reference to a <code class="classname">type_info</code> object representing the given type.</li>
        <li><code>typeid(<var>expression</var>)</code></li>
        <li>If evaluating expression results in a <a href="polymorphism.html">polymorphic</a> type, then expression is evaluated and the result of the <code>typeid</code> operator is a reference to a <code class="classname">type_info</code> object representing the dynamic type of the evaluated expression.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, expression is not evaluated, and the result is a reference to a <code class="classname">type_info</code> object representing the static type</li>
      </ul>

      <aside>For the most part, you shouldn&apos;t ever need to use <code>typeid</code> because any code that is conditionally executed based on the type of the object would be better handled with, for example, virtual member functions.</aside>

      <p>The following code uses <code>typeid</code> to print a message based on the type of the object:</p>
      <pre>class Animal { public: virtual ˜Animal() = default; };
class Dog : public Animal {};
class Bird : public Animal {};

void speak(const Animal&amp; animal)
{
  if (typeid(animal) == typeid(Dog)) {
    println("Woof!");
  } else if (typeid(animal) == typeid(Bird)) {
    println("Chirp!");
  }
};</pre>
      <p>Whenever you see code like this, you should immediately consider reimplementing the functionality as a virtual member function. In this case, a better implementation would be to declare a virtual member function called speak() in the Animal base class. Dog would override the member function to print <q>Woof!</q>, and Bird would override it to print <q>Chirp!</q>. This approach better fits object-oriented programming, where functionality related to objects is given to those objects.</p>

      <aside><strong>WARNING:</strong> The typeid operator works correctly only if the class has at least one virtual member function, that is, when the class has a vtable. Additionally, the typeid operator strips reference and const qualifiers from its argument.</aside>

      <p>One possible use case of the <cod>typeid</cod> operator is for logging and debugging purposes. The following code makes use of <code>typeid</code> for logging. The <code>logObject()</code> function takes a <q>loggable</q> object as a parameter. The design is such that any object that can be logged inherits from the <code class="classname">Loggable</code> class and supports a member function called <code>getLogMessage()</code></p>

      <pre>class Loggable
{
public:
  virtual ˜Loggable() = default;
  virtual string getLogMessage() const = 0;
};

class Foo : public Loggable
{
public:
 string getLogMessage() const override { return "Hello logger."; }
};

void logObject(const Loggable&amp; loggableObject)
{
  print("{}: ", typeid(loggableObject).name());
  println("{}", loggableObject.getLogMessage());
}</pre>
      <p><code>logObject()</code> first prints the name of the object&apos;s class to the console, followed by its log message. This way, when you read the log later, you can see which object was responsible for every written line.</p>
