      <h1>Biology</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>Biology</dfn> is the scientific study of life. It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future generations (<a href="genetics.html">Genetics</a>). Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments (<dfn>homeostasis</dfn>).</p>

        <p><dfn>biology</dfn>, study of living things and their vital processes. The field deals with all the physicochemical aspects of life. [...]</p>
        <p>Biology is subdivided into separate branches for convenience of study, though all the subdivisions are interrelated by basic principles. Thus, while it is customart to separate the study of plants (botany) from that of animals (zoology), and the study of the structure of organisms (morphology) from that of function (physiology), all living things share in common certain biological phenomenaâ€”for example, various means of reproduction, cell division, and the transmission of genetic material.</p>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <p>All living organisms, regardless of their uniqueness, have certain biological, chemical, and physical characteristics in common. All, for example, are composed of basic units known as cells and of the same chemical substances, which, when analyzed, exhibit noteworthy similarities, even in such disparate organisms as bacteria and humans. Furthermore, since the action of any organism is determined by the manner in which its cells interact and since all cells interact in much the same way, the basic functioning of all organisms is also similar.</p>
