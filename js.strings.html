        <h2>UTF-16</h2>
        <p>JavaScript strings are encoded as a sequence of 16-bit numbers. These are called <dfn>code units</dfn>. A Unicode character code was initially supposed to fit within such a unit (which gives you a little over 65,000 characters). When it became clear that wasn&apos;t going to be enough, many people balked at the need to use more memory per character. To address these concerns, UTF-16, the format also used by JavaScript strings, was invented. It describes most common characters using a single 16-bit code unit but uses a pair of two such units for others.</p>
        <p>UTF-16 is generally considered a bad idea today. It seems almost intentionally designed to invite mistakes. It&apos;s easy to write programs that pretend code units and characters are the same thing. And if your language doesn&apos;t use two-unit characters, that will appear to work just fine. But as soon as someone tries to use such a program with some less common Chinese characters, it breaks. Fortunately, with the advent of emoji, everybody has started using two-unit characters, and the burden of dealing with such problems is more fairly distributed.</p>
        <p>JavaScript&apos;s <code>charCodeAt</code> method gives you a code unit, not a full character code. The <code>codePointAt</code> method, added later, does give a full Unicode character, so we could use that to get characters from a string. But the argument passed to <code>codePointAt</code> is still an index into the sequence of code units. To run over all characters in a string, we&apos;d still need to deal with the question of whether a character takes up one or two code units.</p>

      <section id="toString">
        <h2><code>toString()</code></h2>
        <p>When you call the <code>String(<var>OBJ</var>)</code> function (which converts a value to a string) on an object, it will call the <code>toString()</code> method on that object to try to create a meaningful string from it.</p>
        <p>Some of the standard prototypes define their own version of <code>toString</code> so they can create a string that contains more useful information than <q>[object Object]</q>. You can also do that yourself.</p>
        <pre>Rabbit.prototype.toString = function() {
return `a ${this.type} rabbit`;
};</pre>
        <p>which you can use as follows:</p>
        <pre>console.log(String(killerRabbit));
// â†’ a killer rabbit</pre>
        <p></p>
        <pre></pre>
        <p></p>
        <pre></pre>
        <p></p>

      <section id="template">
        <h2>Template Literals/Strings</h2>
        <p><dfn>Template Strings</dfn> use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:</p>
        <pre>let text = `Hello World!`;</pre>
        <p>Features:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Template Strings allow both single and double unscaped quotes inside a string:</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;</pre>
          </dd>
          <dt>Multiline Strings</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Template Strings allow multiline strings</p>
            <pre>let text =
`The quick
brown fox
jumps over
the lazy dog`;</pre>
          </dd>
          <dt>Interpolation</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Template Strings allow variables in strings. They provide an easy way to interpolate variables in strings.</p>
            <p><strong>Syntax</strong></p>
            <pre>${...}</pre>
            <p>Example. Variable Substitutions:</p>
            <pre>let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";

let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`;</pre>
          </dd>
          <dt>Expression Substitution</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Template Strings allow interpolation of expressions in strings.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>let price = 10;
let VAT = 0.25;

let total = `Total: ${(price * (1 + VAT)).toFixed(2)}`;</pre>
          </dd>
          <dt>HTML Templates</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <pre>let header = "Template Strings";
let tags = ["template strings", "javascript", "es6"];

let html = `&lt;h2&gt;${header}&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;`;
for (const x of tags) {
  html += `&lt;li&gt;${x}&lt;/li&gt;`;
}
