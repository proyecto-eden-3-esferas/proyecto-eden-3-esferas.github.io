      <h1>Vertical Farming: Growing Crops in Stacked Layers</h1>
      <p><dfn>Vertical farming</dfn> is an innovative agricultural technique that involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers, possibly inside <a href="greenhouses.html">greenhouses</a>. It is a space-efficient method that allows farmers to maximize production in urban areas or areas with limited land availability.</p>
      <p>In a vertical farming system, crops are grown in vertical racks or towers, with each layer equipped with artificial lighting, irrigation systems, and climate control. This allows farmers to create the ideal growing conditions for each crop, regardless of the external environment.</p>
      <p>One of the key advantages of vertical farming is its ability to produce crops year-round, regardless of the season. By controlling temperature, humidity, and lighting, farmers can create a stable and optimal growing environment, eliminating the dependence on weather conditions.</p>
      <p>Vertical farming also reduces the need for pesticides and herbicides. Since crops are grown indoors, they are less susceptible to pests and diseases. Additionally, the controlled environment helps prevent weed growth, reducing the need for chemical weed control.</p>
      <p>Another benefit of vertical farming is its efficient use of resources. By using hydroponic or aeroponic systems, farmers can grow crops without soil, reducing water usage and eliminating the need for large amounts of arable land. Vertical farming also requires less energy compared to traditional farming methods, thanks to energy-efficient LED lighting and climate control systems.</p>
      <p>By embracing vertical farming, farmers can overcome the challenges of land scarcity, climate change, and limited resources. It offers a sustainable and efficient solution to feed the growing global population while minimizing environmental impacts.</p>
