          <h3>The World is Analog</h3>
          <p>The world is fundamentally analog, and so are the ways we interact with it. Even in the digital age, we still need analog <a target="_blank" href="ic.html">ICs</a>.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Everything is going digital: cell phones, televisions, video disks, hearing aids, motor controls, audio amplifiers, toys, printers, and what have you. Analog design is obsolete or will be shortly, or so most people think.</p>
          <p>Imminent death has been predicted for analog since the advent of the PC. But analog is still here, and analog integrated circuits (ICs) have, in fact, been growing at almost exactly the same rate as digital ones. A digital video disk (DVD) player has more analog content than the VCR—which is analog—ever did.</p>
          <p>The explanation is rather simple: the world is fundamentally analog. Hearing is analog. Vision, taste, touch, and smell—all analog. So are lifting and walking. Generators, motors, loudspeakers, microphones, solenoids, batteries, antennas, lamps, LEDs, laser diodes, and sensors are fundamentally analog components.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>The Digital Revolution is Also Analog</h4>
            <p>The digital revolution is constructed on top of an analog reality. This fact simply won't go away. Somewhere, somehow, you have to get into and out of the digital system and connect to the real world.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the predominance and glamor of digital has done harm to analog. Too few analog designers are being educated, creating a void. This leaves decisions affecting analog performance to engineers with a primarily digital background.</p>

            <p>In integrated circuits, the relentless pressure toward faster digital speed has resulted in ever-decreasing supply voltages, which are anathema to high-performance analog design.</p>
            <p>In a 350 nm process operating at 3.3 V, there’s still enough headroom for a high-performance analog design, though 5 V would be better. At 180 nm (1.8 V), the job becomes elaborate and time-consuming, and performance starts to suffer. At 120 nm (1.2 V), analog design becomes very difficult, even with reduced performance. At 90 nm, analog design is all but impossible.</p>
            <p>There are "mixed signal" processes that purportedly allow digital and analog circuitry on the same chip. A 180 nm process, for example, will have some devices that can work with a higher supply voltage (e.g. 3 V). Such additions are welcome, if marginal. However, the design models are often inadequate and oriented toward digital design.</p>
