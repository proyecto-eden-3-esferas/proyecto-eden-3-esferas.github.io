      <h1>Yam (genus <i lang="la">Diascorea</i>)</h1>
      <p><dfn>Yam</dfn> is the common name for some plant species in the genus Dioscorea (family Dioscoreaceae) that form edible tubers (some other species in the genus being toxic).</p>
      <p>Yams are perennial herbaceous (<a target="_blank" href="monocotyledon.html">monocots</a>) vines native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas and cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions. The tubers themselves, also called <q>yams</q>, come in a variety of forms owing to numerous cultivars and related species.</p>
      <p>Yams are related to lilies and grasses.</p>

      <section id="cultivation">
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p>Yams are cultivated for the consumption of their starchy tubers in many temperate and tropical regions, especially in West Africa, South America and the Caribbean, Asia, and Oceania. About 95% of yam crops are grown in Africa.</p>
        <p>Despite the high labor requirements and production costs, consumer demand for yam is high in certain subregions of Africa, making yam cultivation quite profitable to certain farmers.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>A yam crop begins when whole seed tubers or tuber portions are planted into mounds or ridges, at the beginning of the rainy season. The crop yield depends on how and where the sets are planted, sizes of mounds, interplant spacing, provision of stakes for the resultant plants, yam species, and tuber sizes desired at harvest. Small-scale farmers in West and Central Africa often intercrop yams with cereals and vegetables. The seed yams are perishable and bulky to transport. Farmers who do not buy new seed yams usually set aside up to 30% of their harvest for planting the next year.</p>
        <p>Their growth and dormant phases correspond respectively to the wet season and the dry season.</p>
        <p>For maximum yield, the yams require a humid tropical environment, with an annual rainfall over 1,500 millimetres (59 in) distributed uniformly throughout the growing season. White, yellow, and water yams typically produce a single large tuber per year, generally weighing 5 to 10 kilograms (11 to 22 pounds).</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Pests</h3>
          <p>Yam crops face pressure from a range of insect pests and fungal and viral diseases, as well as nematodes.</p>
          <p>Yams suffer from relatively few pests and diseases. There is an anthracnose caused by <i lang="la">Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</i> which is widely distributed around the world&apos;s growing regions. Winch et al., 1984 finds <i lang="la">C. gloeosporioides</i> afflicts a large number of <i lang="la">Dioscorea spp</i>.</p>
