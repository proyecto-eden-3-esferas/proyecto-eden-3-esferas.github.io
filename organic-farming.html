      <h1>Organic/Sustainable/Regenerative Farming</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>organic farming</strong>, <a target="_blank" href="sustainable-agriculture.html">sustainable agricultural</a> system that uses ecologically based pest controls and biological fertilizers derived largely from animal and plant wastes and nitrogen-fixing cover crops. Modern organic farming was developed as a response to the environmental harm caused by the use of chemical pesticides and synthetic fertilizers in conventional agriculture, and it has numerous ecological benefits.</p>
        <p>Compared with conventional agriculture, organic farming uses fewer pesticides, reduces <a target="_blank" href="soil.html">soil</a> erosion, decreases nitrate leaching into groundwater and surface water, and recycles animal wastes back into the farm. These benefits are counterbalanced by higher food costs for consumers and generally lower yields. Indeed, yields of organic crops have been found to be about 25 percent lower overall than conventionally grown crops, although this can vary considerably depending upon the type of crop. The challenge for future organic agriculture will be to maintain its environmental benefits, increase yields, and reduce prices while meeting the challenges of climate change and an increasing world population.</p>
        <section>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The concepts of organic agriculture were developed in the early 1900s by Sir Albert Howard, F.H. King, Rudolf Steiner, and others who believed that the use of animal manures (often made into compost), cover crops, crop rotation, and biologically based pest controls resulted in a better farming system.</p>
          <p>Howard, having worked in India as an agricultural researcher, gained much inspiration from the traditional and sustainable farming practices he encountered there and advocated for their adoption in the West. Such practices were further promoted by various advocates—such as J.I. Rodale and his son Robert, in the 1940s and onward, who published <cite>Organic Gardening and Farming</cite> magazine and a number of texts on organic farming. The demand for organic food was stimulated in the 1960s by the publication of <cite>Silent Spring</cite>, by Rachel Carson, which documented the extent of environmental damage caused by insecticides.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Organic food sales increased steadily from the late 20th century. Greater environmental awareness, coupled with concerns over the health impacts of pesticide residues and consumption of genetically modified (GMO) crops, fostered the growth of the organic sector. In the United States retail sales increased from $20.39 billion in 2008 to $47.9 billion in 2019, while sales in Europe reached more than $52 billion (€45 billion) in 2019.</p>
          <p>The price of organic food is generally higher than that of conventionally grown food. Depending on the product, the season, and the vagaries of supply and demand, the price of organic food can be anywhere from less than 10 percent below to more than 100 percent above that of conventionally grown produce.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Regulation</h2>
          <p>Organic agriculture is defined formally by governments. Farmers must be certified for their produce and products to be labeled <q>organic</q>, and there are specific organic standards for crops, animals, and wild-crafted products and for the processing of agricultural products. Organic standards in the European Union (EU) and the United States, for example, prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, ionizing radiation, sewage sludge, and genetically engineered plants or products. In the EU, organic certification and inspection is carried out by approved organic control bodies according to EU standards. Organic farming has been defined by the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) since 2000, and there are many accredited organic certifiers across the country.</p>
          <p>Although most countries have their own programs for organic certification, certifiers in the EU or the United States can inspect and certify growers and processors for other countries. This is especially useful when products grown organically in Mexico, for example, are exported to the United States.</p>

        <h2>Organic farming methods</h2>

        <section>
          <h3>Fertilizers</h3>
          <p>Since synthetic fertilizers are not used, building and maintaining a rich, living soil through the addition of organic matter is a priority for organic farmers. Organic matter can be applied through the application of manure, compost, and animal by-products, such as feather meal or blood meal. Due to the potential for harbouring human pathogens, the USDA National Organic Standards mandate that raw manure must be applied no later than 90 or 120 days before harvest, depending on whether the harvested part of the crop is in contact with the ground. Composted manure that has been turned 5 times in 15 days and reached temperatures between 55 and 77.2 °C (131 and 171 °F) has no restrictions on application times.</p>
          <p>Compost adds organic matter, providing a wide range of nutrients for plants, and adds beneficial microbes to the soil. Given that these nutrients are mostly in an unmineralized form that cannot be taken up by plants, soil microbes are needed to break down organic matter and transform nutrients into a bioavailable <q>mineralized</q> state. In comparison, synthetic fertilizers are already in mineralized form and can be taken up by plants directly.</p>
          <p>Soil is maintained by planting and then tilling in cover crops, which help protect the soil from erosion off-season and provide additional organic matter. The tilling in of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, such as clover or alfalfa, also adds nitrogen to the soil. Cover crops are commonly planted before or after the cash crop season or in conjunction with crop rotation and can also be planted between the rows of some crops, such as tree fruits. Researchers and growers are working to develop organic farming <q>no-till</q> and reduced-tillage practices in order to further reduce erosion.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>The use of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, smother crops, and green manures can help restore soils and reduce erosion. Composting crop residues and other agricultural wastes helps recycle nutrients back to the farmland.</p>

          <h3>Pest control</h3>
          <p>Organic pesticides are derived from naturally occurring sources. These include living organisms such as the bacteria <i lang="la">Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, which is used to control caterpillar pests, or plant derivatives such as pyrethrins (from the dried flower heads of <i lang="la">Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium</i>) or neem oil (from the seeds of <i lang="la">Azadirachta indica</i>). Mineral-based inorganic pesticides such as sulfur and copper are also allowed.</p>
          <p>In addition to pesticides, organic pest control integrates biological, cultural, and genetic controls to minimize pest damage. Biological control utilizes the natural enemies of pests, such as predatory insects (e.g., ladybugs) or parasitoids (e.g., certain wasps) to attack insect pests. Pest cycles can be disrupted with cultural controls, of which crop rotation is the most widely used. Finally, traditional plant breeding has produced numerous crop varieties that are resistant to specific pests. The use of such varieties and the planting of genetically diverse crops provide genetic control against pests and many plant diseases</p>

        <section id="polyculture">
          <h3>Polyculture</h3>
          <p>In <dfn>polyculture</dfn>, multiple crops are grown together. Although polyculture is frequently more labour-intensive than industrial monoculture, polyculture can reduce the need for chemical pesticides and fertilizers and generally improves soil quality.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="crop-rotation">
          <h3>Crop Rotation</h3>
          <p>Crop rotation can help preserve soil productivity and lessen the need for agricultural chemicals for fertilization and pest control.</p>
