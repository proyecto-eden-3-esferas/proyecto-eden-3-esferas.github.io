      <h1>Classifier (Linguistics)</h1>
      <p>A <dfn>classifier</dfn> is a word (or in some analyses, a bound morpheme) which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts, and generally reflects some kind of conceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents. Thus a language might have one classifier for nouns representing persons, another for nouns representing flat objects, another for nouns denoting periods of time, and so on. The assignment of classifier to noun may also be to some degree unpredictable, with certain nouns taking certain classifiers by historically established convention.</p>
      <p>The situations in which classifiers may or must appear depend on the grammar of the language in question, but they are frequently required when a noun is accompanied by a numeral. They are therefore sometimes known (particularly in the context of languages such as Japanese) as <strong>counter words</strong>. They may also be used when a noun is accompanied by a demonstrative (a word such as <q>this</q> or <q>that</q>).</p>


      <hr/>

      <p>A classifier (abbreviated clf or cl) is a word or affix that accompanies nouns and can be considered to <q>classify</q> a noun depending on some characteristics (e.g. humanness, animacy, sex, shape, social status) of its referent. Classifiers in this sense are specifically called <dfn>noun classifiers</dfn>. Some languages in Papua as well as the Americas have <dfn>verbal classifiers</dfn>, which categorize a verb.</p>

      <p>In languages that have classifiers, they are often used when the noun is being counted, that is, when it appears with a numeral. In such languages, a phrase such as <q>three people</q> is often required to be expressed as <q>three <var>X</var> (of) people</q>, where <var>X</var> is a classifier appropriate to the noun for <q>people</q>; compare to <q>three blades of grass</q>. Classifiers that appear next to a numeral or a quantifier are particularly called <dfn>numeral classifiers</dfn>. They play an important role in certain languages, especially East and Southeast Asian languages, including Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese.</p>
      <p>Numeral classifiers may have other functions too; in Chinese, they are commonly used when a noun is preceded by a demonstrative (word meaning <q>this</q> or <q>that</q>). Some Asian languages like Zhuang, Hmong and Cantonese use <q>bare classifier construction</q> where a classifier is attached without numerals to a noun for definite reference; the latter two languages also extend numeral classifiers to the possessive classifier construction where they behave as a possessive marker connecting a noun to another noun that denotes the possessor.</p>
      <p>Possessive classifiers are usually used in accord with semantic characteristics of the possessed noun and less commonly with the relation between the possessed and the possessor although possessor classifiers are reported in a few languages (e.g. DÃ¢w).</p>
      <p>Classifiers are absent or marginal in European languages. An example of a possible classifier in English is piece in phrases like <q>three pieces of paper</q>. In American Sign Language, particular classifier handshapes represent a noun&apos;s orientation in space.</p>
      <p>There are similarities between classifier systems and noun classes, although there are also significant differences. While noun classes are defined in terms of agreement, classifiers do not alter the form of other elements in a clause. Also, languages with classifiers may have hundreds of classifiers whereas languages with noun classes (or in particular, genders) tend to have a smaller number of classifiers. Noun classes are not always dependent on the nouns&apos; meaning but they have a variety of grammatical consequences.</p>
