      <h1>Transistors: Controlled Current Sources</h1>
      <p>A <dfn>transistor</dfn> is a three-port (3-pin, 3-legs, 3-terminals) electronics device where a current or a voltage signals controls the intensity of a larger current.</p>

      <aside>
        <p>One of the issues with transistors is that it takes a while before using a transistor becomes intuitive. Transistors, as we will find, wind up needing a lot of special considerations. Because of this, many people don&apos;t use transistors directly and instead choose to only use <a target="_blank" href="ic">integrated circuits</a>. Integrated circuits, since they are based on the needs of a circuit instead of simple physical properties, tend to be much easier to work with. Most of the guess work has been taken out, and the chips are built so that they can be inserted into a circuit in a straightforward way. Even though some people opt to use integrated circuits instead of using transistors directly, it is worthwhile to understand their operation.</p>

        <h2>IGBTs/IEGTs</h2>
        <p>An Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor, IGBT, and an Injection Enhanced Gate Transistor, IEGT, are devices that switch power on and off between a collector and emitter by controlling the voltage between the gate and emitter in the same way as MOSFET.</p>

            <td>Low-voltage power MOSFETs have an extremely low on-state voltage. High voltage devices have a slightly higher on-state voltage. Power MOSFETs have a positive temperature coefficient, which is beneficial in connecting multiple devices in parallel.</td>
