      <h1>Cowpea(s)</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>cowpea,</dfn> (<i lang="la">Vigna unguiculata</i>), annual plant within the pea family (<i lang="la">Fabaceae</i>) grown for its edible legumes. The plants are thought to be native to West Africa and are widely cultivated in warm regions around the world. In addition to their use as a protein-rich food crop, cowpeas are extensively grown as a hay crop and as a green manure or cover crop.</p>
        <p>Cowpeas are typically climbing or trailing vines that bear compound leaves with three leaflets. The white, purple, or pale-yellow flowers usually grow in pairs or threes at the ends of long stalks. The pods are long and cylindrical and can grow 20–30 cm (8–12 inches) long, depending on the cultivar. The plants are heat-adapted and drought-tolerant.</p>
