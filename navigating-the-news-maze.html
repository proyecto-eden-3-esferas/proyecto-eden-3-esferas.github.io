      - Use <strong class='firstterm'>TERM</strong> to denote new terms
      - Use numbered (<ol>) and unnumbered (<ul>) lists of list items (<li>)
      - as well as definition lists like:
      <dl>
        <dt>TERM1</dt>
        <dd>DEF1</dd>
        <dt>TERM2</dt>
        <dd>DEF2</dd>
      </dl>
      - Use asides to include comment and explanations
        when a new page is not warranted, like
      <hr/>
      <aside>
        <h2>HEADER</h2>
        <p>...<strong class='firstterm'>TERM</strong> ... </p>
      </aside>

      <p>A So, how can you navigate this complex media landscape â€“ a world of established news outlets, citizen journalists, and social media feeds brimming with information? Here are some tips to become a discerning news consumer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seek Diverse Sources</strong>: Don&apos;t rely on just one news outlet, especially one that aligns perfectly with your existing beliefs. Explore publications and websites with different viewpoints to get a well-rounded perspective on current events. Look for reputable news organizations known for their commitment to factual reporting and balanced coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider the Source</strong>: Research the reputation and background of the news source you&apos;re consuming. Are they known for accuracy and fairness? Do they have a history of presenting biased or misleading information? Recognizing the source&apos;s potential biases allows you to critically evaluate the information presented.</li>
        <li><strong>Think Beyond Headlines</strong>: Headlines are often designed to grab attention, sometimes at the expense of accuracy or nuance. Read beyond sensational headlines and dig into the details of the story. Look for in-depth reporting that provides context, analysis, and multiple perspectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Fact-Check</strong>: Don&apos;t take everything at face value, especially information encountered on social media. Verify information with credible sources before sharing it further. Utilize fact-checking websites or reputable news organizations known for their investigative journalism to confirm the accuracy of claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Wary of Bias</strong>: Recognize that all media outlets have some degree of bias, even seemingly objective ones. Look for balanced reporting that presents multiple sides of an issue, allowing you to form your own informed opinion.</li>
      </ul>
