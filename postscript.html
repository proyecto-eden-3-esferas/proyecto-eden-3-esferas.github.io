          <p>Among its many other capabilities, PostScript can read or write virtually any disk file format in just about any language. PostScript is a premier choice any time exotic calculations need to be combined with fancy visual presentations. PostScript also has unique robotics potential.</p>

        <aside class="warning">All PostScript programs must begin with the magic characters <kbd>%!PS&#x2212;Adobe&#x2212;2.0</kbd>, or at least with its first four characters (<kbd>%!PS</kbd>). It also seems that after the last command a space character must be typed, although conversion to PDF does not strictly demand this.</aside>

        </aside>
        <p>PostScript is an interpreted, complete, stack-based, weakly- and dynamically-typed programming language with primitives for printing and drawing on an output device. Being a weakly typed programming language means that a variable can hold data of any type and the type of its object can even change throghout the running of the program... that is at interpretation as oposed to compilation. Like other programming languages, PostScript uses variables and functions (<dfn>procedures</dfn>), has a sufficient set of control structures, comparison, arithmetic and logical operators, console and file input-output, and so on.</p>
        <p>Some remarks on PostScript are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>That PostScript uses <dfn>postfix</dfn> notation means that an operator follows (the "post" part in PostScript) its operands. Thus the expression 1 + 30 in PostScript is written "1 3 add". This feature is tightly tied to PostScript's being stack-based.  When the interpreter encounters the token "1" it <em>pushes</em> "1" onto a stack, then encounters and pushes "3", and last encounters operator "add", which assumes two numeric operands on the stack, and executes it.</li>
          <li>PostScript is probably the only complete programming language that offers primitives for drawing and printing on a page. Moreover, a PDF document can be generated from a PostScript program, usually through a utility named <strong class="application">ghostscript</strong>. To this end at each moment during execution (interperation) the <dfn>graphics state</dfn> may be in a "current point", have a given "linewidth", color, "transformation matrix", "path", etc.</li>
          <li>PostScript offers three data structures: <dfn>dictionaries</dfn>, which basically are associative arrays and are used much like namespaces, <dfn>arrays</dfn>, and <dfn>strings</dfn> of characters (actually bytes), which are very similar to arrays and share many of their features and accessors but can additionally be used to print text on a page. Both arrays and strings are random access, sliceable (operator "getinterval"), carry information about their size, are copyable by value (operator "copy") etc.</li>
          <li>PostScript is dynamically typed. A variable or procedure is created by associating a name to any other element in the programming language: another name, a number, a string, an array, or a block of executable code, by means of operator "def". For example "/greeting (Hello!) def" associates name "/greeting" with string (Hello!) in the current dictionary. But further down a script the name "/greeting" can be associated with an element of a different type, such as a procedure, as in "/greeting {(Hello!) show} def". In fact PostScript has no concept of variables as opposed to procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <section id="ps_stack">
          <h3>The PostScript Stack (and its Operators)</h3>
          <p>PostScript uses postfix notation. This is more than a syntactic feature. Postfix operators operate on operands that have been pushed onto a virtual stack. This <i class="foreignphrase">modus operandi</i> supports implementations on machines with lean RAM, such as printers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><kbd>dup</kbd>: duplicates an item, that is pushes a copy of itself</li>
            <li><kbd>copy</kbd>: similar to dup, only it takes another argument, the number of (top) items to be copied. <kbd>1 copy</kbd> does the same as <kbd>dup</kbd>.</li>
            <li><kbd>index</kbd>: it takes a number, an index to an item, and returns the item. For example, <kbd>0 index</kbd> returns the top item, just as <kbd>dup</kbd>.</li>
            <li><kbd>roll</kbd>: performs a rotation. The first argument is the number of items or depth of stack that rotates, and the second arguments is the number of places that this chunk rotates. Thus, <kbd>2 1 roll</kbd> is the same as <kbd>exch</kbd>.</li>
            <li><kbd>exch</kbd>: exchanges or <q>swaps</q> the two top items on the stack. Thus, <kbd>\first \second exch</kbd> leaves the stack <code class="computeroutput">\second \first</code>.</li>
            <li><kbd>count</kbd>: returns how many items are on the stack</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some other operators are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><kbd>=</kbd>: print the top item on standard output</li>
            <li><kbd>==</kbd>: print the top item on standard output</li>
            <li><kbd>cleartomark</kbd>: </li>
            <li><kbd>mark</kbd>: </li>

          <h3>On Being Dynamic and Interpreted</h3>
          <p>PostScript is both dynamically-typed and interpreted. Maybe these two go hand in hand...</p>
          <section>
            <h4>The Variable-Procedure Duality</h4>
            <p>In PostScript a name may be associated to a constant value (such as another name, a number, a string, an array) or to a procedure. Throughout the run of a PostScript program a name may change its type between constant and procedure, too.</p>
            <p>Consider how the distance between two lines (<var>lead</var>) may be defined subtly differently in terms of <var>fontscale</var>. First as a constant:</p>
            <pre>/lead fontscale def</pre>
            <p>Then as a procedure:</p>
            <pre>/lead {fontscale} def</pre>
            <p>As long as <var>fontscale</var> doesn't change, the former definition results in faster execution. Perhaps we should do all our font changes through an intelligent procedure (<code class="function"><a href="#ps_myselectfont">myselectfont</a></code>) that updates <var>lead</var> as a constant, among other tasks.</p>

          <h3>Binding</h3>
          <p>Binding a procedure replaces all executable operator names by their values. The overall effect is that all procedure names as well as procedures nested in those procedures and so on become tightly bound to their original definitions. When a bound procedure is executed, the interpreter encounters the operators themselves rather than the names.</p>
          <p>Thus, the <kbd>bind</kbd> operator implements a form of static binding. It trades in dynamic binding for speed.</p>
          <aside class="warning">You must never <kbd>bind</kbd> a procedure that takes another procedure as it input or that relies on other procedures that might change after the procedure to be bound has been declared.</aside>

          <h3>Non-Programmatic or Flat PostScript</h3>
          <p>It is possible to use PostScript as a page description language and do all the logic in another programming language such as C++ that will produce a PostScript file. You would eschew all comparison and control structures, mathematics, loops, dictionary and array features, etc.</p>
          <p>These are the PostScript operators you would need to do everything possible:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>path construction operators: <kbd>newpath</kbd>, <kbd>moveto</kbd>, <kbd>rmoveto</kbd>, <kbd>lineto</kbd>, <kbd>rlineto</kbd>, <kbd>curveto</kbd>, <kbd>rcurveto</kbd>, and <kbd>closepath</kbd>;</li>
            <li>font selection operators: either <kbd>findfont</kbd>, <kbd>scalefont</kbd>, and <kbd>setfont</kbd>, or just <kbd>selectfont</kbd>;</li>
            <li>for showing text: <kbd>show</kbd>, and probably also <kbd>widthshow</kbd> (to stretch to right margin by widening inter-word spacing) and <kbd>charpath</kbd>;</li>
            <li>to eject a page: <kbd>showpage</kbd> </li>
            <li>to stroke or fill a path: <kbd>stroke</kbd> and <kbd>fill</kbd>;</li>
            <li>to select a color or shade of gray: <kbd>setrgbcolor</kbd>, <kbd>setymckcolor</kbd>, <kbd>sethsbcolor</kbd>, and <kbd>setgray</kbd>;</li>
            <li>for saving and restoring the graphic context: <kbd>gsave</kbd> and <kbd>grestore</kbd>;</li>
            <li>for clipping: <kbd>clip</kbd> </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You would probably like to use, too:</p>

        <h2>Direct PostScript</h2>
        <p>David Byram-Wigfield has called <dfn>direct PostScript</dfn> as work created by writing in PostScript from the start. PostScript is a powerful language that is not difficult to begin to learn, can express sophisticated graphical ideas in few words, and has the final say as to just where every mark appears on the output, giving unsurpassed visual control.</p>
        <p>PostScript is a full programming language tailored to graphics, so it is great for getting a computer/printer to do many precise, repetitive, calculated things all on its own. Design, illustration, and typesetting can all involve precise, repetitive, calculated things, and direct PostScript techniques are justly popular with people who would rather tell the computer to do the work than drag it by the mouse every step of the way.</p>
        <p>It could be said that pure, vanilla PostScript is hardly ever&#x2014;except for simple jobs&#x2014;the language you really write in: you write in a language that you get by sending a prolog of one or more resources that grow PostScript into a language suiting your job, which may retain the basic syntax and flavor of PostScript, or have a whole new look.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Benefits: PostScript in the small</h3>
          <p>Frequent, low-volume projects with highly individualized requirements can be natural jobs for direct PostScript. Often it is easy with a WYSIWYG program to get ninety percent of the desired result, and then the last ten percent becomes a battle with the program's built-in style or assumptions. Even if you can find the way to tell the program what you want, it is not guaranteed to be easier than to say it in PostScript&#x2014;and to say it in PostScript can be the more promising investment, in learning coherent concepts of one established graphical language rather than workarounds and tricks for a hodge-podge of application programs.</p>
          <p>For those doing mathematical figures, the point could not be made better than by Bill Casselman in his book, <cite>Mathematical Illustrations</cite>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The truth is that the trade-off is unnecessary--once one has made a small initial investment of effort, by far the best thing to do in most situations is to write a program in the graphics programming language PostScript. [...] The apparent complexity involved in producing simple figures by programming in PostScript, as I hope this book will demonstrate, is largely an illusion. And the amount of work involved in producing more complicated figures will usually be neither more nor less than what is necessary.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>For those who have taken to heart Edward Tufte's work on presenting information visually, there is no such thing any more as a generic chart or graph. Any information display worth making is worth making with close attention to how all the visual and typographic aspects combine to convey the information without distortion or distraction. A sampling of published papers in some fields might invite the conclusion that many charts and graphs were not worth making! The trouble is, they are typically made with software that tries to make charts and graphs generic, and then offers a cornucopia of ways to dress them up with gee-whiz chartjunk that adds nothing to the presentation.</p>
          <p>All the ornamentation and noise in that sort of a graph would be tedious to replicate in PostScript&#x2014;but a clean, readable graph is not hard, and in PostScript your control over the position and typography of every element, legend, and callout is more direct than in any graphing program.</p>
          <p>Don Lancaster's pages (see below) offer examples of many other publishing-in-the-small projects&#x2014;stationery, cards and numbered tickets, fancy borders (exactly the kind of repetitive work the computer excels at) and so on&#x2014;where direct PostScript can be the way to go.</p>

        <h2>PostScript Data Types and Objects</h2>
        <section id="ps_simple_and_composite_objects">
          <h3>Simple and Composite Objects and Virtual Memory (VM) in PostScript</h3>
          <p>There are two classes of objects: simple and composite. A simple object's value is contained in the object itself. A composite object's value is stored separately; the object contains a reference to it. The <a href="#ps_vm">virtual memory (VM)</a> is the storage in which the values of composite objects reside.</p>
          <p>For example, the program fragment</p>
          <pre>234 (Here is a string)</pre>
          <p> pushes two objects, an integer and a string, on the operand stack. The integer, which is a simple object, contains the value 234 as part of the object itself. The string, which is a composite object, contains a reference to the value (Here is a string), which is a text string that resides in VM. The elements of the text string are characters (actually, integers in the range 0 to 255) that can be individually selected or replaced.</p>
          <p>Here is another example:</p>
          <pre>{234 (Here is a string)}</pre>
          <p>This pushes a single object, a two-element executable array, on the operand stack. The array is a composite object whose value resides in VM. The value in turn consists of two objects, an integer and a string. Those objects are elements of the array, which can be individually selected or replaced.</p>
          <p>Several composite objects can share the same value. For example, in</p>
          <pre>{234 (Here is a string)} dup</pre>
          <p>the <code class="function">dup</code> operator pushes a second copy of the array object on the operand stack. The two objects share the same value&#x2014;that is, the same storage in VM. So, replacing an element of one array will affect the other. Other types of composite objects, including strings and dictionaries, behave similarly.</p>
          <p>Creating a new composite object consumes VM storage for its value.</p>

        <h2>PostScript Virtual Memory (VM)</h2>

        <section id="ps_local_and_global_vm">
          <h3>PostScript Local and Global Virtual Memory (VM)</h3>
          <p>There are two divisions of VM containing the values of <a href="#ps_simple_and_composite_objects">composite objects</a>: local and global. Only composite objects occupy VM. An <q>object in VM</q> means a <q>composite object whose value occupies VM</q>; the location of the object (for example, on a stack or stored as an element of some other object) is immaterial.</p>
          <aside>Global VM exists only in Level 2 and Display PostScript implementations of the PostScript language. In Level 1 implementations, all of VM is local.</aside>
          <p>Local VM is a storage pool that obeys a stack-like discipline. Allocations in local VM and modifications to existing objects in local VM are subject to a feature called save and restore, named after the operators that invoke it. save and restore bracket a section of a PostScript language program whose local VM activity is to be encapsulated. restore deallocates new objects and undoes modifications to existing objects that were made since the matching save.</p>
          <p>Global VM is a storage pool for objects that don't obey a fixed discipline. Objects in global VM can come into existence and disappear in an arbitrary order during execution of a program. Modifications to existing objects in global VM are not affected by occurrences of save and restore within the program. However, an entire job's VM activity can be encapsulated, enabling separate jobs to be executed independently.</p>
          <p>In a hierarchically structured program, such as a page description, local VM is used to hold information whose lifetime conforms to the structure; that is, it persists to the end of a structural division, such as a single page. Global VM may be used to hold information whose lifetime is independent of the structure, such as definitions of fonts and other resources that are loaded dynamically during execution of a program.</p>
          <p>Control over allocation of objects in local versus global VM is provided by the <code class="function">setglobal</code> operator (a Level 2 feature). This operator establishes a VM allocation mode, a boolean value that determines where subsequent allocations are to occur (false means local, true means global). It affects objects created implicitly by the scanner and objects created explicitly by operators. The default VM allocation mode is local; a program can switch to global VM allocation mode when it needs to.</p>

          <p>Some of these are read-only (systemdict), some read-writeable.</p>
          <p>In Level 1 implementations of the PostScript language, there are two built-in dictionaries permanently on the dictionary stack; they are called systemdict and userdict. In Level 2 implementations, there are three dictionaries: systemdict, globaldict, and userdict.</p>
          <ul>

        <h2>PostScript Resources</h2>
        <p>A <dfn>resource</dfn> is a collection of named objects that either reside in <a href="#ps_vm">VM</a> or can be located and brought into VM on demand.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>PostScript Resource Operators</h3>
          <p>There are five operators that apply to resources: <code class="command">findresource</code>, <code class="command">resourcestatus</code>, <code class="command">resourceforall</code>, <code class="command">defineresource</code>, and <code class="command">undefineresource</code>. These operators and the general concept of named resources are Level 2 features. A more limited facility applicable only to fonts&#x2014;the <code class="command">findfont</code> and <code class="command">definefont</code> operators&#x2014;is available in Level 1.</p>
          <p>The <code class="command">findresource</code> operator is the key feature of the resource facility. Given a resource category name and an instance name, <code class="command">findresource</code> returns an object. If the requested resource instance does not already exist as an object in VM, <code class="command">findresource</code> gets it from an external source and loads it into VM. A PostScript language program can access named resources without knowing if they are already in VM or how they are obtained from external storage.</p>
          <p>Other important features include <code class="command">resourcestatus</code>, which returns information about a resource instance, and <code class="command">resourceforall</code>, which enumerates all available resource instances in a particular category. These operators apply to all resource instances, whether or not they reside in VM; the operators do not cause the resource instances to be brought into VM. <code class="command">resourceforall</code> should be used with care and only when absolutely necessary, since the set of available resource instances is potentially extremely large.</p>
          <p>A program can explicitly define a named resource instance in VM. That is, it can create an object in VM, then execute <code class="command">defineresource</code> to associate the object with a name in a particular resource category. This resource instance will be visible in subsequent executions of <code class="command">findresource</code>, <code class="command">resourcestatus</code>, and <code class="command">resourceforall</code>. A program can also execute <code class="command">undefineresource</code> to reverse the effect of a prior <code class="command">defineresource</code>. The <code class="command">findresource</code> operator automatically executes <code class="command">defineresource</code> and <code class="command">undefineresource</code> to manage the VM for resource instances that it obtains from external storage.</p>
          <p>Resource instances can be defined in either <a href="#ps_local_and_global_vm">local or global VM</a>. The lifetime of the definition depends on the VM allocation mode in effect at the time the definition is made. Normally, both local and global resource instances are visible and available to a program. However, when the current VM allocation mode is global, only global instances are visible; this ensures correct behavior of resource instances that are defined in terms of other resource instances.</p>
          <p>When a program executes <code class="command">defineresource</code> to define a resource instance explicitly, it has complete control over whether to use local or global VM. However, when execution of <code class="command">findresource</code> causes a resource instance to be brought into VM automatically, the decision whether to use local or global VM is independent of the VM allocation mode at the time <code class="command">findresource</code> is executed. Usually, resource instances are loaded into global VM; this enables them to be managed independently of the save and restore activity of the executing program. However, certain resource instances do not function correctly when they reside in global VM; they are loaded into local VM instead.</p>
          <p>The language does not specify a standard method for installing resources in external storage. Installation typically consists of writing a named file in a file system. However, details of how resource names are mapped to file names and how the files are managed are environment dependent. In some environments, resources may be installed using facilities entirely separate from the PostScript interpreter.</p>
          <p>Resource instances are identified by keys that ordinarily are name or string objects; the resource operators treat names and strings equivalently. Use of other types of keys is permitted but not recommended. The <code class="command">defineresource</code> operator can define a resource instance with a key that is not a name or string; the other resource operators can access the instance using that key. However, such a key can never match any resource instance in external storage.</p>

        <h2>Coordinate Systems and Transformations</h2>
        <p>Paths and shapes are defined in terms of pairs of points on the Cartesian plane specified as coordinates. A coordinate pair is a pair of real numbers x and y that locate a point within a Cartesian (two-axis) coordinate system superimposed on the current page. The PostScript language defines a default coordinate system that PostScript language programs can use to locate any point on the current page.</p>
        <p>Coordinates specified in a PostScript language program refer to locations within a coordinate system that always bears the same relationship to the current page regardless of the output device on which printing or displaying will be done. This coordinate system is called <dfn>user space</dfn>.</p>
        <p>Initially, the user space origin is located at the lower-left corner of the output page or display window, with the positive x axis extending horizontally to the right and the positive y axis extending vertically upward, as in standard mathematical practice. The length of a unit along both the x and y axes is 1/72 of an inch. This coordinate system is the <dfn>default user space</dfn>. In default user space, all points within the current page have positive x and y coordinate values.</p>

            <p><code class="command">FontDirectory</code> pushes a dictionary of defined fonts on the operand stack. FontDirectory is not an operator; it is a name in <var>systemdict</var> associated with the dictionary object.</p>
            <p>The <var>FontDirectory</var> dictionary associates font names with font dictionaries. <code class="command">definefont</code> places entries in <var>FontDirectory</var>, and <code class="command">findfont</code> looks there first. The dictionary is read-only; only <code class="command">definefont</code> and <code class="command">undefinefont</code> can change it.</p>
            <p>Although <var>FontDirectory</var> contains all fonts that are currently defined in <a href="#ps_vm">VM</a>, it does not necessarily describe all the fonts available to a PostScript language program. This is because the <code class="command">findfont</code> operator can sometimes obtain fonts from an external source and load them into VM dynamically. Consequently, examining FontDirectory is not a reliable method of inquiring about available fonts. The preferred method is to use the <code class="command">resourcestatus</code> and <code class="command">resourceforall</code> operators, which are Level 2 features, to inquire about the <var>Font</var> resource category. (See section Named Resources.)</p>
            <p>In Level 2, when global VM allocation mode is in effect (see section Local and Global VM), the name <var>FontDirectory</var> is temporarily rebound to the value of <var>GlobalFontDirectory</var>, which contains only those fonts that have been defined in global VM. This ensures the correct behavior of fonts that are defined in terms of other fonts.</p>

          <h3>Having PostScript Declare an Array of Widths for Each of its Fonts</h3>
          <p>The intended purpose of this is to let another program written in a more congenial programming language (C, C++, etc.) do the computing and output a <em>dumb</em> PostScript script.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Printing the widths of a font for C, C++, or other</h4>
            <p>The actual procedure used is slightly involved because it declares an array of 256 widths as well as a two dimensional array of 256 fourfold items representing the bounding box of each character. (The Bounding Box of a picture is the coordinates of its lower left-hand and upper right-hand corners.)</p>
            <p> I have named it <code class="computeroutput">definecharbb</code>. It takes the name of an existing (possibly reencoded) font, a more convenient name without hyphens, and a string holding the name of the output file. It depends on variable <code class="computeroutput">definecharbb_fontscale</code>, which is defined as 10. Its code is:</p>

          <h3>Making or Changing Fonts</h3>
          <aside>Most of this section has been borrowed or adapted from <cite>PostScript Language Tutorial and CookBook</cite>, by Adobe Systems Incorporated, 1985, which is distributed free of charge.</aside>
          <p>The first example, <a href="#ps_re-encoding_an_entire_font">Re-encoding an Entire Font,</a> presents a general procedure (<code class="function">ReEncode</code>) for changing the encoding vector of a font. The second example, <a href="#ps_making_small_changes_to_encoding_vectors">Making Small Changes to Encoding Vectors,</a> presents an alternative to replacing the entire encoding vector for situations when the encoding vector only needs to be changed slightly. Most of the built-in fonts contain characters that have not been encoded, such as accented characters. To print such characters, the name of the character must be inserted into the encoding vector. However, we do not want to specify the entire encoding vector to insert a few new characters so the procedure <code class="function">ReEncodeSmall</code> has been defined to handle this insertion.</p>
          <p>The third example, <a href="#ps_changing_char_widths">Changing the Character Widths of a Font,</a> defines a general procedure, <code class="function">ModifyWidths,</code> for changing some or all of the character widths in a given font. It changes the necessary entries in the font dictionary. In this example the character widths of a font are rounded such that when the characters are printed at a certain point size, the widths will be an integral number of pixels in device space. This is useful for avoiding round-off error in positioning characters with the show operator.</p>
          <p>The fourth program, <a href="#ps_creating_an_analytic_font">Creating an Analytic Font,</a> demonstrates how to create a new font whose character descriptions are geometric in nature. The program defines all the necessary font dictionary entries as well as some new entries of its own. The font created has 4 characters: bullets of three sizes and an open box shape. Each character is described using the PostScript graphic operators. After the font has been defined it is used in an example that prints the various characters intermixed with one of the built-in fonts.</p>
          <!-- <p>The final program, <a href='#ps_creating_a_bitmap_font'>Creating a Bitmap Font,</a> demonstrates an efficient way to create a new font whose character descriptions are bitmaps.</p> -->
          <section id="ps_copy_font">
            <h4>Copying a Font</h4>
            <p>Since fonts are kept in dictionaries, you copy them by declaring a long-enough dictionary and copying everything but the ID field.</p>
            <p>There are two important steps to remember when copying a font. The first is not to copy the <var>FID</var> field from the original font dictionary to the new dictionary. The <var>FID</var> field will automatically get created when the <code class="function">definefont</code> operator is executed. Attempting to perform a <code class="function">definefont</code> operation on a dictionary that already contains an <var>FID</var> field results in an <q>invalidfont</q> error. The second step is to change the <var>FontName</var> field in the new dictionary. The same name which appears in the <var>FontName</var> field should be provided as an argument to the <code class="function">definefont</code> operator. <em>The <var>FontName</var> should always be a unique name.</em></p>
            <p>In addition, for fonts that have a <var>UniqueID</var> field, it is important to change the <var>UniqueID</var> field when the font is modified. The only case when the <var>UniqueID</var> field should not be changed is when the <var>Encoding</var> field of a font dictionary has been changed.</p>
            <aside class="warning">Changing the <var>UniqueID</var> should be done with care. See the programs <a href="#ps_making_an_outline_font">Making an Outline Font</a> and <a href="#ps_changing_char_widths">Changing the Character Widths of a Font</a> for examples of this.</aside>

          <section id="ps_reencode_font">
            <h4>Re-Encoding a Font</h4>
            <p>To reencode a font you have to <a href="#ps_copy_font">copy</a> everything in it except the ID and then define your own <var>Encoding</var> array variable.</p>
            <p>The encoding vector is a mapping of character codes (in the range of 0 to 255) to character names.</p>
            <p>A font can hold more than 256 glyphs. An encoding is a mapping from the range of naturals 0-255 to 256 glyphs in the font or fewer. Most of the built-in fonts are encoded according to a standard encoding, which allows access to only the ASCII character set, good enough for English, inadequate for Spanish, French, German etc.</p>
            <p>Reencoding entails defining a new font (which is a type in the PostScript programming language).</p>
            <p>Below is a general encoding procedure. Further down we define a more specific procedure for encoding into ISOLATIN1.</p>
            <pre>/ReEncode {
  reencodedict begin
    /newencoding exch def
    /newfontname exch def
    /basefontname exch def
    /basefontdict basefontname findfont def
    /newfont basefontdict maxlength dict def
    basefontdict {
      exch dup dup /FID ne exch /Encoding ne and
      { exch newfont 3 1 roll put }
      { pop pop }
      ifelse
    } forall
    newfont /FontName newfontname put
    newfont /Encoding newencoding put
    newfontname newfont definefont pop
  end
} def</pre>
            <p>Usually we want to redefine a font to the ISOLatin1 encoding, as its tables are included in the documentation. We shall avail ourselves of the following convenient PostScript procedure lifted from the internet:</p>
            <pre id="EncodeAsISOLatin1">/EncodeAsISOLatin1 { % usage: /existingFont /newfont EncodeAsISOLatin1
  /newfontname exch def
  findfont            %
  dup length dict begin
  { 1 index /FID ne
    {def} {pop pop} ifelse
  } forall
  /Encoding ISOLatin1Encoding def
  currentdict
  end
  newfontname exch definefont pop
} def/</pre>
            <p>and is used like this:</p>
            <pre>/Times-Roman /Times-Roman-ISOLatin1 EncodeAsISOLatin1
/Times-Bold /Times-Bold-ISOLatin1 EncodeAsISOLatin1
...</pre>
            <p>When encoding accented characters it is important to understand that accented characters (also known as <dfn>composite characters</dfn>) are actually a composite of the letter and the accent. In order to print accented characters properly, both the letter and the accent of the composite character must be encoded in the encoding vector, as well as the composite character itself. For example, if you wish to encode the composite character <var>Aacute</var> both the <var>A</var> and the <var>acute</var> must be encoded.</p>

            <h4>Modifying Existing Fonts</h4>
            <p> The basic strategy for modifying an existing font is to create an entirely new font dictionary and to copy all the references to entries in the original font dictionary, except for the <var>FID</var> entry, into the new dictionary. The next step is to modify the appropriate fields. The last step is to perform a <code class="function">definefont</code> operation on the modified font dictionary to make it into a PostScript font.</p>

            <h4>Creating New Fonts</h4>
            <p>When creating new fonts, certain font dictionary entries must be present. They are FontMatrix, FontType, FontBBox, Encoding and BuildChar. For a user defined font, the FontType should always have the value 3. In addition, it is useful, although not necessary, to have a UniqueID entry. The UniqueID entry facilitates better caching of characters on disk-based implementations of the PostScript interpreter. (Be forewarned that the UniqueID must truly be a unique 24 bit number and that the creator of the font is responsible for ensuring this.)</p>
            <p>The BuildChar procedure is responsible for specifying how a character in the new font is rendered. It should always call either the setcachedevice or setcharwidth operator. The BuildChar procedure can use almost all of the PostScript operators to render a character. However, there are some restrictions when the character is to be cached (i.e., when the setcachedevice operator has been used). In this case, any of the operators related to gray-level and color are invalid (e.g., setgray, setrgbcolor, image, etc).</p>
            <p id="ps_font_notdef">In the character descriptions for a new font, it is a good idea to create a character description that will be printed for <em>undefined</em> characters. This character is called <q>.notdef</q> in the built-in fonts, and it is defined to print nothing. When users try to print characters that have not been defined in the font, the <q>.notdef</q> character is printed; the <q>.notdef</q> character is a graceful way of avoiding unexpected errors. As well as creating a character description for the undefined character, it is important that the encoding vector have the name of this undefined character in each location that does not have a character defined. The simplest way to do this is to initialize all the entries in the encoding vector to contain the <q>.notdef</q> character and then enter the character names in the desired positions.</p>

        <h2>Pdfmarks</h2>
        <p><dfn>pdfmarks</dfn> are an extension of PostScript&#xAE; code used to represent PDF features.</p>
        <p>PDF features defined by pdfmarks are automatically generated when the PostScript code is converted into a PDF.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>What can you do with pdfmarks?</h3>
          <p>pdfmarks enable you to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>ADD annotations, links, form fields, bookmarks, articles, named destinations, page transitions</li>
            <li>SET page cropping, to open to a specific page, to open with bookmarks or thumbnails displayed</li>
            <li>DEFINE page labels, document information fields</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In other words many of the enhancements that make PDFs dynamic and interactive can be implemented with pdfmarks.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Understanding pdfmarks</h3>
          <p>Pdfmarks have three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Every pdfmark starts with the mark object - this is the [ (left bracket) character.</li>
            <li>Arguments: these describe what the pdfmark's features are. These are the ingredients of the pdfmark recipe.</li>
            <li>A name: this specifies the kind of pdfmark.</li>
          </ul>
          <pre>[

  /Rect [ 0 0 216 144 ]
  /Open true
  /Title (Lynn)
  /Contents (This is a Red Note)
  /Color [1 0 0 ]
  /Subtype /Text

  /ANN pdfmark</pre>
          <aside>Most pdfmark arguments resemble PDF dictionary keys. This is an important fact to remember. If you are unsure how to construct a specific argument sometimes you can open a pdf that contains a similar feature and determine from the dictionary entry (reverse engineer) how the pdfmark entry should look.</aside>
          <p>Arguments are expressed as Key-Value pairs. Each type of pdfmark uses a set of required and optional key-value pairs. Some key-value pairs are specific to a type of pdfmark, some are used more globally.</p>
          <p>Keys, being PostScript <q>names</q>, start with a slash (/), followed by the name of the key (first character capitalized). Some examples of keys are: <kbd>/Rect</kbd>, <kbd>/Color</kbd>, <kbd>/Page</kbd>.</p>
          <p>Values can be expressed in several different formats: string, array, integer, boolean, name.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Specifying page numbers</h4>
            <p>All pages in a PDF document are numbered sequentially; the first page in a document is page 1. When referring to pages in a pdfmark recipe, all page numbers must be specified using this sequence number, not the page number as it appears on the printed page.</p>
            <p>This is an example of an argument specifying a page number:</p>
            <pre>/Page 2</pre>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Defining Colors</h4>
            <p>Colors are defined by an array of three numbers placed between brackets that represent RGB values and look something like this: <kbd>[1 0 .65 ]</kbd>.</p>
            <p>These numbers must be 0, 1 or any decimal in between and represent percentages of Red, Green and Blue. Percentages between 0 and 100% are defined by decimals. There is no required number of digits to the right of the decimal point. 1, .6, ,.25, .824 are all valid.</p>
            <p>This is an example of an argument that defines color:</p>

          <h3>Specifying Actions and Destinations</h3>
          <p>When a user opens a file, clicks on a link, or clicks on a bookmark, there are several types of information that need to be specified in order to indicate what should happen. Different pdfmark types require one or more of the following:</p>
          <dl>
            <!-- <varlistentry> -->
            <dt>
              <a href="#pdfmark_actions">Actions</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Actions specify what type of action should be taken. They are indicated by the <kbd>Action</kbd> key in a pdfmark.</p>
            </dd>
            <!-- </varlistentry> -->
            <!-- <varlistentry> -->
            <dt>
              <a href="#pdfmark_destinations">Destinations</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>Destinations specify a particular location in a file, and a zoom factor.</p>
              <p>View destinations require a <kbd>Page</kbd> key and a <kbd>View</kbd> key. Typically they are used along with an <kbd>Action</kbd> key; if there is no <kbd>Action</kbd> key, the action is the equivalent of <kbd>GoTo</kbd>, meaning to jump to the destination in the current file.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, named destinations can be used, specified by the <kbd>Dest</kbd> key. They specify a destination in the same file or another file, by name.</p>
            </dd>
            <!-- </varlistentry> -->

            <h4><kbd>pdfmark</kbd> actions</h4>
            <p>PDF defines several types of actions that can be specified for bookmarks and annotations. The types defined as of PDF 1.3 are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>GoTo</kbd>: Go to a destination in the current document</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>GoToR</kbd>: Go to a destination in another document</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Launch</kbd>: Launch an application, usually to open a file</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Thread</kbd>: Begin reading an article thread</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>URI</kbd>: Resolve a uniform resource identifier</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Sound</kbd>: Play a sound</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Movie</kbd>: Play a movie</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Hide</kbd>: Set an annotation's Hidden flag</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>Named</kbd>: Execute an action predefined by the viewer application</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>SubmitForm</kbd>: Send data to a URL</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>ResetForm</kbd>: Set fields to their default values</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>ImportData</kbd>: Import field values from a file</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><kbd>JavaScript</kbd>: Execute a JavaScript script</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When using pdfmark, the type of action for the annotation or bookmark is specified by the <kbd>Action</kbd> key. It takes one of the following values:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A predefined name corresponding to one of the first four items in the foregoing table: GoTo, GoToR, Launch, or Article (which corresponds to the Thread type in PDF).</li>
              <li>
                <p>A dictionary specifying one of the other types, or a custom action. This dictionary must contain the key&#x2013;value pairs that are to be placed into the action dictionary in the PDF file. See Section 8.5 in the <cite>PDF Reference</cite> for a detailed description of all the actions and their dictionaries. The syntax for this type of <kbd>Action</kbd> key is:</p>
                <pre>/Action &lt;&lt; / Subtype actiontype
...other action dictionary key&#x2013;value pairs... &gt;&gt;</pre>
                <p>If the <kbd>Action</kbd> key is not present, the action is assumed to be the equivalent of <kbd>GoTo</kbd>; that is, jumping to a location in the current document. Actions other than <kbd>GoTo</kbd> may require a file-specifier key to specify an external document</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

              <p>The zoom factors for the horizontal and vertical directions are identical; there are not separate zoom factors for the two directions.

For example, when using <kbd>FitR</kbd>, portions of the page outside the destination rectangle appear in the window, unless the window happens to have the same aspect ratio (height-to-width ratio) as the destination rectangle.</p>
              <p>A common destination is <q>upper left corner of the specified page, with a zoom factor of 1.</q> This can be obtained using the <kbd>XYZ</kbd> destination form, with a <var>left</var> of -4 and a <var>top</var> equal to the top of the <kbd>CropBox</kbd> (or the page size if no <kbd>CropBox</kbd> was specified) plus 4. The offset of 4 is used to slightly move the page corner from the corner of the window, to provide a visual cue that the corner of the page is being shown.</p>

              <h5>Named Destinations</h5>
              <p>Locations in PDF files can be specified by name instead of by page number and view. These names can then be used as destinations of bookmarks or links. Using named destinations is particularly advantageous for cross-document links, because if the document containing a link's destination is revised, the link will still work, regardless of whether its location in the file has changed.</p>

          <h3>Page Cropping (<kbd>PAGES</kbd>, <kbd>PAGE</kbd>)</h3>
          <p>Page cropping is used to specify the dimensions of a page or pages in a PDF file that will be displayed or printed (without altering the actual data in the file). Cropping is specified by using the pdfmark operator in conjunction with the names <kbd>PAGES</kbd> (for the entire document) or <kbd>PAGE</kbd> (for an individual page).</p>
          <p>The syntax for specifying the default page cropping for a document is:</p>
          <pre>[ /CropBox [xll yll xur yur]
  /PAGES pdfmark</pre>
          <p>The syntax for specifying a non-default page cropping for a particular page in a document is:</p>
          <pre>[ /CropBox [xll yll xur yur]
  /PAGE pdfmark</pre>
          <p>The <kbd>CropBox</kbd> key is an array representing the location and size of the viewable area of the page. <kbd>CropBox</kbd> is an array of four numbers [xll, yll, xur, yur] specifying the lower-left x, lower- left y, upper-right x, and upper-right y coordinates&#x2014;measured in default user space&#x2014;of the rectangle defining the cropped page. The minimum allowed page size is .04 x .04 inch (3 x 3 units) and the maximum allowed page size is 200 x 200 inches (14,400 x 14,400 units) in the default user space coordinate system.</p>
          <p>The <kbd>PAGES</kbd> pdfmark can be placed anywhere in the PostScript language program, but it is recommended that it be placed at the beginning of the file, in the Document Setup section between the document structuring comments <kbd>%%BeginSetup</kbd> and <kbd>%%EndSetup</kbd>, before any marks are placed on the first page.</p>
          <p>The <kbd>PAGE</kbd> pdfmark must be placed before the <kbd>showpage</kbd> operator for the page it is to affect. It is recommended that it be placed before any marks are made on the page. For example, it affects only the first page of a document if it is placed before any marks are made on the first page.</p>

          <h3>Info Dictionary (<kbd>DOCINFO</kbd>)</h3>
          <p>A document's Info dictionary contains key&#x2013;value pairs that provide various pieces of information about the document. Info dictionary information is specified by using the pdfmark operator in conjunction with the name <kbd>DOCINFO</kbd>.</p>
          <p>The syntax for specifying Info dictionary entries is:</p>
          <pre>[ /Author       <code class="classname">string</code>
  /CreationDate <code class="classname">string</code>
  /Creator      <code class="classname">string</code>
  /Producer     <code class="classname">string</code>
  /Title        <code class="classname">string</code>
  /Subject      <code class="classname">string</code>
  /Keywords     <code class="classname">string</code>
  /ModDate      <code class="classname">string</code>
  /DOCINFO pdfmark</pre>
          <p>All the allowable keys are <code class="classname">string</code>s, and they are all optional. In addition to the keys listed above, arbitrary keys (which must also take <code class="classname">string</code> values) can be specified.</p>
          <p><kbd>/Producer</kbd> is the name of the application that converted the document from its native form to PDF.</p>
          <p>The date and time the document was last modified should be of the form:</p>
          <blockquote class="equation">(D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm')</blockquote>
          <p><q>D:</q> is an optional prefix. YYYY is the year. All fields after the year are optional. MM is the month (01-12), DD is the day (01-31), HH is the hour (00-23), mm are the minutes (00-59), and SS are the seconds (00-59). The remainder of the string defines the relation of local time to GMT. O is either + for a positive difference (local time is later than GMT) or - (minus) for a negative difference. HH' is the absolute value of the offset from GMT in hours, and mm' is the absolute value of the offset in minutes. If no GMT information is specified, the relation between the specified time and GMT is considered unknown. Regardless of whether or not GMT information is specified, the remainder of the string should specify the local time.</p>

        <h2>Tips, Common Idioms, and Techniques</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>Name scope is usually needed to avoid name clash and enables reusing short, easy, descriptive names inside procedures and other blocks.</p>
          <p>Name scope in PostScript is enforced through local dictionaries. Graphic scope is enforced through "gsave"..."grestore" blocks.</p>
          <section>
            <h4>Variables Writeable from Anywhere</h4>
            <p>A global variable can be read from anywhere. But writing to it from inside a local, enclosed dictionary just creates a same-named local variable (think "association") that is lost as soon as the interpreter leaves the local dictionary. Consider the scenario of a global variable "pagenum" and a procedure that attempts to increment it from within a local dictionary:</p>
            <pre>/pagenum 0 def
3 dict begin
  /pagenum pagenum 1 add def
end</pre>
            <p>The code inside the local dictionary just creates a local variable "/pagenum" with value 2. When the dictionary closes, all its associations get lost and forgotten.</p>
            <p>The workaround is to define a named dictionary at the top level -and therefore accessible everywhere- meant to hold global writeable variables. You may call it "writeabledict", "commondict" or whatever. For instance you would code:</p>
            <pre>/commondict 20 dict def
commondict begin
  /pagenum pagenum 1 add def
end</pre>
            <p>or just:</p>
            <pre>/commondict 20 dict def
commondict /pagenum 1 put</pre>
            <p>You could write accessors to read and modify "commondict", possibly availing yourself of operators "put" and "get":</p>
            <pre>/getpagenum {commondict /pagenum get} def
/resetpagenum {commondict /pagenum 1 put} def
/incpagenum {commondict /pagenum getpagenum 1 add put} def</pre>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h4>Dictionaries</h4>
            <p>Dictionaries are scopes where names are mapped to other objects such as numbers, arrays, strings, procedures or possibly names or dictionaries, too. They behave very much like namespaces in C++.</p>
            <p>You create a dictionary on the stack by pushing a positive integer followed by procedure <code class="function">dict</code>. The positive integer is the dictionary's initial capacity, which in later versions grows automatically on demand. Afterwards, a dictionary is opened by operator <code class="function">begin</code>, and is closed by operator <code class="function">end</code>. The following code creates an unnamed dictionary, opens it, declares some variables (<var>c<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>c<sub>2</sub></var>), uses them to show the square root of c<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + c<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, and closes it without polluting the global namespace.</p>
            <pre>5 dict begin
  /c1 3 def
  /c2 4 def
  c1 dup mul c2 dup mul add sqrt  =
end</pre>
            <p>Dictionaries define local scope, so they are used heavily in the body of procedures. Also they are good for prototyping complex behaviour or computations. They resemble classes in OOP.</p>

            <p>A <dfn>mixin</dfn> is a class that contains members for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. Mixins are sometimes described as being <q>included</q> rather than <q>inherited</q>.</p>

          <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
          <p>Polymorphism means a procedure's behaving differently according to the type of the operands. Many standard operators exhibit some degree of polymorphism: "copy", "get", and "put" are applied to arrays, strings, and dictionaries, for instance.</p>
          <p>To implement polimorphism use operator "type", which returns a name, one of /stringtype, /arraytype, /nametype, and so on. For instance, to use an input argument which is either a name or a string, you might code:</p>
          <pre>dup type /nametype eq {...}{...} ifelse</pre>
          <p>In the first block you would process the argument as a name, in the second as a string.</p>

          <h3>Common PostScript Idioms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are going to use an argument inside a procedure more than once, it may be convenient to define it inside a local unnamed dictionary: "1 dict begin /myvar exch def ... end"</li>
            <li>You can define several arguments on the stack like this: "[/name_n ... /name2 /name1] {exch def} forall"</li>
            <li>To check if any element of an array fullfills a condition, which is given in a procedure ({cond}) reading one argument and returning true or false, code like this: "false &lt;array&gt; {{cond} exec or} forall" When "forall" finishes executing the top of the stack will be either true or false.</li>
            <li>Move into a local graphic context while keeping the current point like this: "currentpoint gsave moveto ... grestore".</li>
            <li>To fill and stroke a path, notice that either "fill" or "stroke" erase the current path. To fill the path in gray, and then stroke its outline, code "... gsave 0.5 setgray fill grestore stroke"</li>

        <h2>Encapsulated PostScript</h2>
        <p>An encapsulated PostScript file is a PostScript language program describing the appearance of a single page. Typically, the purpose of the EPS file is to be included, or <q>encapsulated,</q> in another PostScript language page description. The EPS file can contain any combination of text, graphics, and images, and it is the same as any other PostScript language page description with only a few restrictions</p>
        <p>At minimum, an EPS file contains a header comment (<kbd>%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0</kbd>) and a BoundingBox DSC comment, describing the rectangle containing the image described by the EPS file. Applications can use this information to lay out the page, even if they are unable to directly render the PostScript inside. An application importing an EPS file must parse the EPS file for DSC comments and extract at least the bounding box and resource dependencies of the EPS file.Here is a typical EPS prolog:</p>
        <pre>%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0

        <p>The four arguments of the bounding box comment correspond to the lower-left (<var>llx</var>, <var>lly</var>) and upper-right (<var>urx</var>, <var>ury</var>) corners of the bounding box. They are expressed in the default PostScript coordinate system. For an EPS file, the bounding box is the smallest rectangle that encloses all the marks painted on the single page of the EPS file.</p>
        <p>Graphics state information, such as the current line width and line join parameters, must be considered when calculating the bounding box. The following example shows a minimally conforming EPS file that draws a square with a line width of 10 units.</p>
        <pre>%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
%%BoundingBox: 5 5 105 105
10 setlinewidth
10 10 moveto
0 90 rlineto 90 0 rlineto 0 -90 rlineto closepath
stroke</pre>
        <p>If the line width were not considered when calculating the bounding box, the bounding box would be incorrectly positioned by five units on each side of the square, causing the application to incorrectly place and clip the imported EPS file. The bounding box specified for this example is therefore correct.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>EPS Restrictions</h3>
          <p>The EPS program must not use operators that initialize or permanently change the state of the machine in a manner that cannot be undone by the enclosing application's use of save and restore (e.g.. the operators starting with <q>init</q>, such as <code class="function">initgraphics</code>). As a special case, the EPS program may use the showpage operator. The importing application is responsible for disabling the normal effects of showpage. The EPS program should make no environment-sensitive decisions (the importing application may be trying to attain some special effect, and the EPS program shouldn't screw this up), although it can use some device-dependent tricks to improve appearance such as a snap-to-pixel algorithm.</p>
          <p>There are some operators that should not be used within an EPS file: banddevice, cleardictstack, copypage, erasepage, exitserver, framedevice, grestoreall, initclip, initgraphics, initmatrix, quit, renderbands, setglobal, setpagedevice, setshared and startjob. These also include operators from statusdict and userdict operators like legal, letter, a4, b5, etc. There are some operators that should be carefully used: nulldevice, setgstate, sethalftone, setmatrix, setscreen, settransfer and undefinefont.</p>

          <h3>Including EPS files in Plain TeX</h3>
          <p>You can use the simple epsf package which is designed for plain TeX:</p>
          <pre>\input epsf
%optional \epsfxsize=dimen or \epsfysize=dimen
\epsfbox{filename.eps}</pre>

            <h4>Including EPS files in Plain TeX (<code class="command">pdftex</code> Users)</h4>
            <p>For pdftex users the \pdfximage approach might seem appealing. The \pdfximage command creates an image object. The dimensions can be controlled in a similar way to a rule, i.e.</p>
            <pre>\pdfximage width ... height ... depth ... &lt;general text&gt;</pre>
            <p>where &lt;general text&gt; is the file name. (\pdfximage has many more parameters which can be looked up in the pdftex manual. For advanced things such as adjusting the bounding box also consult the manual.)</p>
            <p>Still, \pdfximage only creates an object but does not insert anything yet. Therefore \pdfrefximage has to be used. The command</p>
            <pre>\pdfrefximage &lt;integer&gt;</pre>
            <p>places a whatsit including the image stored in the object referred to by &lt;integer&gt; in the output at shipout. In principle one could output the number corresponding to each image object, write them down and then later do, e.g. \pdfrefximage3. This is tedious and error prone, though. That's why there is \pdflastximage which is a count register always containing the number of the last \pdfximage, so including an image can be boiled down the following code</p>
            <pre>\pdfximage width 3cm {example-image-a.pdf}
\pdfrefximage\pdflastximage

          <h3>Recurrent Pictures</h3>
          <p>For a picture such as an electronic component that is to be drawn several times you need a template. I suggest that you create a dictionary for each class... These are the steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>define a dictionary to paint your component</li>
            <li>include procedures <code class="function">initialize</code>, <code class="function">drawat</code>, possibly <code class="function">drawscaledat</code> too, and so on...</li>
            <li>after that, make it readonly, so that it must be copied in order to be modified</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Such a dictionary you might use like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Copy it into a named or unnamed dictionary.</li>
            <li>Change or redefine its parameters inside it.</li>
            <li>Call <code class="function">initialize</code> once, and</li>
            <li>
              <i class="foreignphrase">presto</i>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>You may also derive another dictionary from it and thereby reuse parameters and procedures. All you have to do is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Copy it.</li>
            <li>Change or add some parameters.</li>
            <li>Write an <code class="function">initialize</code> procedure that calls the previous <code class="function">initialize</code> and does some more work as well.</li>
            <li>Overwrite your <code class="function">drawat</code> procedure and such maybe to call previous <code class="function">drawat</code> first thing.</li>
            <li>Don't forget to run <code class="function">initialize</code>.</li>

          <h3>Selecting the Paper Size</h3>
          <p>Ghostscript is distributed configured to use U.S. letter paper as its default page size. There are two ways to select other paper sizes from the command line:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>If the desired paper size is <a href="#gs_paper_sizes">known to Ghostscript</a>, you can select it as the default paper size for a single invocation of Ghostscript by using the <kbd>-sPAPERSIZE=</kbd> switch, for instance:</p>
              <pre>-sPAPERSIZE=a4</pre>
              <pre>-sPAPERSIZE=legal</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Otherwise you can set the page size using the pair of switches:</p>
              <pre>-dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS=<var>w</var> -dDEVICEHEIGHTPOINTS=<var>h</var></pre>
              <p>Where <var>w</var> be the desired paper width and <var>h</var> be the desired paper height in points (units of 1/72 of an inch).</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Individual documents can (and often do) specify a paper size, which takes precedence over the default size. To force a specific paper size and ignore the paper size specified in the document, select a paper size as just described, and also include the <kbd>-dFIXEDMEDIA</kbd> switch on the command line.</p>

          <h3>Overriding Definitions With CommandLine Switches</h3>
          <p>You can pass parameters into your program with a switch like so:</p>
          <pre>-s<var>PARAM</var>=<var>VALUE</var></pre>
          <p>Yet, if your commandline parameter is defined inside your file, its value gets lost. You need to <em>conditionally</em> define parameters inside your file. Use the <code class="command">where</code> operator, as in <code class="function">ifnotdefthendefas</code> procedure below:</p>
          <pre>/ifnotdefthendefas { %stack: /name obj
  exch
  dup where {pop pop pop} {exch def} ifelse
} def</pre>
          <p>You may also define a procedure that conditionally defines a variable or procedure:</p>
          <pre>/ifnotdefthendef {1 index where {pop pop pop}{def} ifelse} def</pre>

          <h3>GhostScript Bounding Box Output</h3>
          <p>There is a special bbox <q>device</q> that just prints the bounding box of each page. You select it in the usual way:</p>
          <pre>gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=bbox</pre>
          <p>It prints the output in a format like this:</p>
          <pre>%%BoundingBox: 14 37 570 719
%%HiResBoundingBox: 14.308066 37.547999 569.495061 718.319158</pre>
          <p>Currently, it always prints the bounding box on stderr; eventually, it should also recognize <kbd>-sOutputFile=</kbd>.</p>
          <p>Note that this device, like other devices, has a resolution and a (maximum) page size. As for other devices, the product (resolution x page size) is limited to approximately 500K pixels. By default, the resolution is 4000 DPI and the maximum page size is approximately 125 inches, or approximately 9000 default (1/72 inches) user coordinate units. If you need to measure larger pages than this, you must reset both the resolution and the page size in pixels, e.g.,</p>
          <pre>gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=bbox -r100 -g500000x500000</pre>
