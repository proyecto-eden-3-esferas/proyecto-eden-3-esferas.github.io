      <h1>Text To Speech (TTS) Software</h1>
      <p>Text-to-speech (TTS) technology is a form of assistive technology that converts written text into spoken words. This technology has been widely used in various applications, including screen readers, voice assistants, and language translation tools. TTS engines work by processing text input and generating synthetic speech output that resembles human speech.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Installing and Running <code>espeak</code></h2>
        <p>I first tried <code>espeak</code>, with mixed results, before trying <a href="festival.html">Festival</a>, reported to have a steep learning curve. I installed the following linux packages:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>espeak</code></li>
          <li><code>espeak-data</code></li>
          <li><code>espeak-ng-data</code>: necessary synthesiser data files needed for the espeak-ng program and the shared library.</li>
          <li><code>espeakedit</code>, which provides a User Interface to edit the eSpeak voices.</li>
          <li><a href="#mbrola"><code>mbrola</code></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Documentation in <cite>/usr/share/doc/espeak/docs/index.html</cite>, just open <cite>/usr/share/doc/espeak/docs/index.html</cite>.</p>
        <p>All in all a meagre 3.2 MB of additional hard-disk space.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>I play <a target="_blank" href="spec-example-1.ssml">an SSML file</a>:</p>
        <pre>espeak -m -f spec-example-1.ssml</pre>
        <pre></pre>
        <p>Then I test Spanish speech synthesis:</p>
        <pre>espeak -s 140 -p 60 -ves "Hola. Me llamo Francisco Fernández-Victorio Hernández."</pre>
        <p>I play a longish file, too:</p>
        <pre>espeak -s 170 -p 60 -ves -f /dev/shm/<var>WHATEVER</var>.txt</pre>
      </section>

      <section id="mbrola">
        <h2><code>Mbrola</code></h2>
        <p>Mbrola is Thierry Dutoit's phonemiser for multilingual speech synthesis. The various diphone databases are distributed on separate packages, but they must be used with and only with Mbrola because of license matters. Read the copyright for details.</p>
        <p>Mbrola itself doesn't provide full TTS. It is a speech synthesizer based on the concatenation of diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input, together with prosodic information (duration of phonemes and a piecewise linear description of pitch), and produces speech samples on 16 bits (linear), at the sampling frequency of the diphone database.</p>
        <p>Use Mbrola along with Freephone, cicero or espeak to have a complete text-to-speech in English.</p>

        <h2>Opinions and Comparisons</h2>
        <p>A message by Jonathan Duddington in 2008 explains:</p>
        <pre>
&gt; It would be great if somebody who thinks that <a href="festival.html">Festival</a>
&gt; is actually worse than eSpeak in quality of speech
&gt; could try to elaborate more about the reasons.

It depends what you mean by &quot;quality&quot;.

There is no doubt that the good Festival voices sound more human than
eSpeak.

I'm not blind, but I use text-to-speech a lot for reading blogs, news
articles, etc.  The main reasons why I prefer to listen to eSpeak
rather than Festival are:

1.  Clarity.  The eSpeak voice (I use British English) sounds more
clear, and sharp, and more articulated.  An alternative description
might be &quot;artificial and harsh&quot;.

The perceived quality of eSpeak may depend on your loudspeakers.  I use
a domestic sound system with big speakers and it sounds good to me.
But eSpeak has less &quot;bass&quot; and more mid-frequencies than other
synthesizers, and perhaps that's less suitable for small computer
speakers where it sounds more &quot;harsh&quot;?  People have experimented with
new eSpeak &quot;voice variants&quot; with changes to the &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;formant&quot;
parameters to change the tonal balance.

2.  Intonation (the changes in pitch during a sentence).  Festival
seems more &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;.  I prefer eSpeak's more lively
intonation (although that may not sound good for some languages).
Perhaps it's possible to make a new improved intonation algorithm in
Festival.

Note that you can use eSpeak as a front-end to a Mbrola diphone voice,
so you get eSpeak's intonation with a more natural sounding voice
(intonation with Mbrola was improved in eSpeak version 1.31 and later).
http://espeak.sf.net/mbrola.html.
Try comparing Festival with eSpeak+Mbrola.

&gt; This is why eSpeak is the current default in Speech Dispatcher
&gt; because it is initially easier to get running and it covers a great
&gt; span of languages. The documentation however strongly suggest
&gt; users whose language is supported by Festival to try it as their
&gt; primary syntesizer for a better voice quality.

That is good advice, especially since the quality of different
languages in eSpeak is very variable.</pre>
