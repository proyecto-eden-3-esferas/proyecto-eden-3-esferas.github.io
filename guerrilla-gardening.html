      <h1>Guerrilla Gardening</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>Guerrilla gardening</dfn> is the act of gardening – raising food, plants, or flowers – on land that the gardeners do not have the legal rights to cultivate, such as abandoned sites, areas that are not being cared for, or private property. It encompasses a diverse range of people and motivations, ranging from gardeners who spill over their legal boundaries to gardeners with a political purpose, who seek to provoke change by using guerrilla gardening as a form of protest or direct action.</p>
        <p>This practice has implications for land rights and land reform; aiming to promote re-consideration of land ownership in order to assign a new purpose or reclaim land that is perceived to be in neglect or misused.</p>
        <p>Some gardeners work at night, in relative secrecy, in an effort to make the area more useful or attractive, while others garden during the day.</p>

        <p>I lived in the city without access to my own garden for many years. (Now I know there are alternatives like container gardens.)</p>
        <p>It was around this time that I learned about herbs and <a target="_blank" href="foraging.html">foraging</a>, and I long to get my hands in the dirt and grow some plants of my own.</p>
        <p>Luckily, it was also around this time that I learned about <strong>guerrilla gardening</strong>, which opened up my world to the possibilities of growing plants without your own garden. The practice of guerrilla gardening satisfied my budding green thumb while also revitalizing neglected urban areas in my neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Guerrilla gardening is a very rewarding practice that helps to combat urban decay. I hope you try it out, and maybe create your own community of gardening bandits!</p>
        <p>Hi, I&apos;m Leslie!</p>
        <p>My name is Leslie, and I&apos;m the founder of PunkMed! On my blog, I and my team share my info, experiences, and recommendations in the area of sustainability, urban homesteading, and gardening. Our goal is to make it less overwhelming for you to live a fun and sustainable life!</p>
        <p>I&apos;ve been guerrilla gardening for almost 10 years now, and I&apos;m so excited to share my top tips! Let&apos;s get into it!</p>
        <p>Guerrilla gardening gets its name from <q>guerrilla warfare</q>, a military tactic that involves ambushing the opponent, typically used by smaller rebel groups.</p>
        <p>Guerrilla gardening is much more peaceful, but it does involve some sneakiness.</p>
        <p>Guerrilla gardening is the practice of growing plants in vacant lots, highway meridians, and other neglected urban and suburban areas. Basically, it&apos;s gardening on land that you don&apos;t own. Many see guerrilla gardening as a form of activism that rehabilitates otherwise abandoned spaces lost to urban decay.</p>
        <p>Indeed, while this practice is usually not authorized (hence the <q>guerrilla</q>), there are ways to go about it that are pretty harmless and fun. While guerrilla gardening ideas below are pretty hands-off, I still recommend getting permission beforehand. Always guerrilla garden wisely.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Guerrilla Gardening</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>Complete Guide to Guerrilla Gardening 2024</cite>, at <code><a target="_blank" href="https://punkmed.com/blog/guerrilla-gardening/">https://punkmed.com/blog/guerrilla-gardening/</a></code>)</p>
        <p>There are many benefits to starting a guerrilla gardening practice, or even a collective:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Beautification of Urban Areas:</strong> Guerrilla gardening can transform neglected or unsightly urban spaces into green areas, adding beauty and vibrancy to neighborhoods.</li>
          <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> It fosters a sense of community ownership and pride as neighbors come together to improve shared spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Food Production:</strong> Guerrilla gardens can grow fruits, vegetables, and herbs, providing fresh produce to local communities, especially in food deserts where access to fresh produce is limited.</li>
          <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> The addition of green spaces helps to improve air quality, reduce urban heat islands, and provide habitat for wildlife, contributing to biodiversity conservation.</li>
          <li><strong>Promotion of Local Food Systems:</strong> By growing food locally, guerrilla gardening supports local food systems and reduces reliance on long-distance transportation and the global food supply chain.</li>
          <li><strong>Fostering Resilience:</strong> Guerrilla gardening can help communities become more resilient to economic downturns or food shortages by promoting self-sufficiency and community cooperation.</li>
          <li><strong>Political Activism:</strong> In some cases, guerrilla gardening is a form of political activism, challenging property laws and advocating for access to green spaces in urban environments.</li>

        <h2>Best Plants for Guerrilla Gardening</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>Complete Guide to Guerrilla Gardening 2024</cite>, at <code><a target="_blank" href="https://punkmed.com/blog/guerrilla-gardening/">https://punkmed.com/blog/guerrilla-gardening/</a></code>)</p>
        <p>The best plants for guerrilla gardening will always be plants that are native to your area. Native plants are naturalized to the climate of your region, and will be able to grow with minimal intervention or watering.</p>
        <p>If you don&apos;t know which plants are native to your area, I recommend visiting your local nursery to ask which seeds grow best in your area without watering.</p>
        <p>Native plants will also provide the proper habitat for local beneficial insects, particularly pollinators, and other wildlife. Plus, using native plans ensures you are not introducing invasive plants to the area.</p>
        <p>Still, the common choices for guerrilla gardening that provide shelter for beneficial insects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mustard</li>
          <li>Buckwheat</li>
          <li>Fennel</li>
          <li>Dill</li>
          <li>Clover</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Wildflowers for Guerrilla Gardening:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Echinacea</li>
          <li>Yarrow</li>
          <li>Goldenrod</li>
          <li>Sunflower</li>
        </ul>
