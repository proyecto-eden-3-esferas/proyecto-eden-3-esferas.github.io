      <h1>Symbols in Lisp</h1>
      <p>A symbol in Lisp is unique in a namespace (or package in Common Lisp). Symbols can be tested for equality with the function <code>EQ</code>.</p>
      <p>Lisp programs can generate new symbols at runtime. When Lisp reads data that contains textual represented symbols, existing symbols are referenced. If a symbol is unknown, the Lisp reader creates a new symbol.</p>
      <p>In Common Lisp, symbols have the following attributes: a name, a value, a function, a list of properties and a package.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In Common Lisp it is also possible that a symbol is not interned in a package. Such symbols can be printed, but when read back, a new symbol needs to be created. Since it is not interned, the original symbol can not be retrieved from a package.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In Common Lisp symbols may use any characters, including whitespace, such as spaces and newlines. If a symbol contains a whitespace character, it needs to be written as <code>|this is a symbol|</code>. Symbols can be used as identifiers for any kind of named programming constructs: variables, functions, macros, classes, types, goto tags and more. Symbols can be interned in a package.</p>
      <p>Keyword symbols are self-evaluating, and interned in the package named <var>KEYWORD</var>.</p>

      <h3 class="bridgehead">Examples</h3>
      <p>The following is a simple external representation of a Common Lisp symbol:</p>
      <pre>this-is-a-symbol</pre>
      <p>Symbols can contain whitespace (and all other characters):</p>
      <pre>|This is a symbol with whitespace|</pre>
      <p>In Common Lisp symbols with a leading colon in their printed representations are keyword symbols. These are interned in the keyword package.</p>
      <pre>:<var>keyword-symbol</var></pre>
      <p>A printed representation of a symbol may include a package name. Two colons are written between the name of the package and the name of the symbol.</p>
      <pre><var>package-name</var>::<var>symbol-name</var></pre>
      <p>Packages can export symbols. Then only one colon is written between the name of the package and the name of the symbol.</p>
      <pre><var>package</var>:<var>exported-symbol</var></pre>
      <p>Symbols not interned in a package can also be created and have their own notation:</p>
      <pre>#:<var>uninterned-symbol</var></pre>
