      <h1>List of Biomes</h1>

      <section> <h2>Arctic*</h2> </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tundra</h2>
        <p>A tundra has extremely inhospitable conditions, with the lowest measured temperatures of any of the five major biomes with average yearly temperatures ranging from -34 to 12 degrees Celsius (-29 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit). They also have a low amount of precipitation, just 15–25 centimeters (six to ten inches) per year, as well as poor quality soil nutrients and short summers.</p>
        <p>There are two types of tundra: arctic and alpine. The tundra does not have much biodiversity and vegetation is simple, including shrubs, grasses, mosses, and lichens. This is partly due to a frozen layer under the soil surface, called <strong class='firstterm'>permafrost</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Boreal Forest (Taiga)</h2>
        <p>Boreal forests are found at higher latitudes than temperate (deciduous) forests, and have the colder and drier climate, with precipitation occurring primarily in the form of snow.</p>
        <p>There are found coniferous trees such as spruce, fir, and pine. The taiga is an important habitat for many animals, including moose, wolves, and bears. It is also an important source of wood for the paper and construction industries.
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Woodlands (Temperate Deciduous Forest)</h2>
        <p>Woodlands are habitats where the main plants found are trees, but mosses, ferns and lichen can also be found.</p>
        <p>The climate is warm and mild, with more rain falling in the winter than in the summer.</p>
        <p>Deciduous trees lose their leaves in fall. The natural decaying of the fallen leaves enriches the soil and supports all kinds of plant and animal life. The deciduous forest is a lively place, where oak, beech, ash, and maple trees are typical, and wildflowers, berries, and many types of insect and animal life abound. But the fertile soil is also good for people, and in Europe most of the deciduous forest has been destroyed to make room for farms and homes. In the U.S., the deciduous forest is a home for deer, American gray squirrels, wood mice, rabbits, raccoons, woodpeckers, cardinals, and finches, to name a few.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Temperate Grasslands</h2>
        <p>Temperate grasslands are found further away from the equator, in South Africa, Hungary, Argentina, Uruguay, North America, and Russia. They do not have any trees or shrubs, and receive less precipitation than savannas. Prairies and steppes are two types of temperate grasslands; prairies are characterized as having taller grasses, while steppes have shorter grasses.</p>
        <p>Temperate grasslands are home to a variety of animals, including bison, prairie dogs, and coyotes. These animals have adapted to the cold climate by developing thick fur and other features that help them survive in the harsh environment.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Dry Woodlands and Shrublands (Chaparral)</h2>
        <p>The chaparral biome, characterized by its Mediterranean climate of wet winters and dry summers, is a unique and diverse ecosystem predominantly found in regions like the Mediterranean basin and California. This biome is dominated by dense, evergreen shrubs and small trees, adapted to survive in the dry and often fire-prone environment. The chaparral’s vegetation has thick, waxy leaves to minimize water loss, and many plants are specially adapted to recover from frequent wildfires, with some even requiring fire for seed germination. The wildlife in chaparral areas is varied, including species like deer, coyotes, and numerous bird species, all adapted to the challenges of this dry, dense environment.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mountains and High Plateaus</h2>
        <p> Mountains are usually found in groups called chains or ranges, although some stand alone. A mountain biome is very cold and windy. The higher the mountain, the colder and windier the environment. There is also less oxygen at high elevations.</p>
        <p>The animals of this biome have adapted to the cold, the lack of oxygen, and the rugged landscape. They include the mountain goat, ibex (wild goat), sheep, mountain lion, puma, and yak. All of them are excellent climbers, which means they can move freely in the steep, rocky landscape. Types of plants vary depending on geographic location and altitude. Lower elevations are commonly covered by forests, while very high elevations are usually treeless.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tropical Dry Forest</h2>
        <p>Tropical dry forests grow in places where rainfall is highly seasonal rather than year-round. During the dry season, nearly all the trees drop their leaves to conserve water. A tree that sheds its leaves during a particular season each year is called <strong class="firstterm">deciduous</strong>.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Desert</h2>
        <p>Deserts are dry all year round.</p>
        <p>Deserts are dry areas where rainfall is less than 50 centimeters (20 inches) per year. They cover around 20 percent of Earth&apos;s surface.</p>
        <p>Only a few plants might grow, such as small shrubs or cacti, because the soil is shallow and rocky. Animals come out at dusk when it is cooler.</p>
        <p>Deserts can be either cold or hot, although most of them are found in subtropical areas. Because of their extreme conditions, there is not as much biodiversity found in deserts as in other biomes. Any vegetation and wildlife living in a desert must have special adaptations for surviving in a dry environment. Desert wildlife consists primarily of reptiles and small mammals. Deserts can fall into four categories according to their geographic location or climatic conditions: hot and dry, semiarid, coastal, and cold.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>Hot Deserts</h3>
          <p>Hot deserts are found in regions close to the equator, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa and the Mojave Desert in North America. They are characterized by their high temperatures, with some regions experiencing temperatures of up to 50°C during the day.</p>
          <p>The soil in hot and dry deserts is typically sandy and rocky, and rainfall is very low. As a result, plants in these regions have adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Cacti and other succulents are common in hot and dry deserts, as they are able to store water in their fleshy stems and leaves. Shrubs with small leaves are also common, as they are able to minimize water loss through transpiration.</p>
          <p>Animals in hot deserts have also adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Some animals, such as snakes and lizards, are able to regulate their body temperatures by basking in the sun during the day and seeking shelter at night. Others, such as camels, are able to go for long periods without water.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Cold Deserts</h3>
          <p>Cold deserts are found in regions further away from the equator, such as the Gobi Desert in Asia and the Patagonian Desert in South America. They are characterized by their extreme temperatures, with some regions experiencing temperatures as low as -40°C at night.</p>
          <p>The soil in cold deserts is typically sandy and gravelly, and rainfall is very low. Plants in these regions have adapted to survive in harsh conditions by having deep roots that are able to reach water sources underground. Shrubs with small leaves and tough stems are also common in cold deserts. Animals in cold deserts have also adapted to survive in harsh conditions. Some animals have thick fur coats that help them to retain body heat. Others are able to go for long periods without water.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Tropical Rainforest</h2>
        <p>Tropical rainforests are found in Asia, Africa, South America, Central America, and on many of the Pacific islands. They are often found along the equator. Almost half of the world&apos;s tropical rainforests are in the South American country Brazil.</p>
        <p> Tropical rainforests receive at least 70 inches of rain each year and have more species of plants and animals than any other biome. Many of the plants used in medicine can only be found in tropical rainforests. The combination of heat and moisture makes this biome the perfect environment for more than 15 million plants and animals. The thick vegetation absorbs moisture, which then evaporates and completes the cycle by falling again as rain.</p>
        <p>A rainforest grows in three levels. The canopy, or tallest level, has trees between 100 and 200 feet tall. They block most of the sunlight from the levels below. The second level, or understory, contains a mix of small trees, vines, and palms as well as shrubs and ferns. The third and lowest level is the forest floor, where herbs, mosses, and fungi grow.</p>
        <p>Rainforests are an endangered biome. People have cut the trees and sold the wood for firewood, building materials, and paper. Parts of the rainforest have been burned to make space for grazing and farming. Every minute, approximately 30 acres of rainforest are destroyed. The large amounts of carbon dioxide that are released due to the cutting and burning of rainforests contribute to the greenhouse effect.</p>
        <p>Some of the animals of the tropical rainforest are the anteater, jaguar, brocket deer, lemur, orangutan, marmoset, macaw, parrot, sloth, and toucan. Among the many plant species are bamboo, banana trees, rubber trees, and cassava.</p>

        <h2>Tropical Savanna</h2>
        <p>The savannah is hot all year round with a long, dry season.</p>
        <p>Savannas are found closer to the equator and can have a few scattered trees. They cover almost half of the continent of Africa, as well as areas of Australia, India, and South America. </p>
        <p>They are home to lots of different types of animals such as elephants, zebras and wildebeest.</p>
      </section>

      <section> <h2>Semidesert/Arid Grassland*</h2> </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Freshwater</h2>
        <p>Freshwater biomes are those that are found in bodies of water with low salt concentration, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds and other wetlands. These biomes are home to a diverse range of plant and animal species, including algae, plankton, fish, and amphibians.</p>
        <p>One of the most important factors that affect freshwater biomes is climate. Changes in temperature and precipitation can have a significant impact on the health of these ecosystems. For example, droughts can cause water levels to drop, which can lead to the death of fish and other aquatic organisms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Marine</h2>
        <p>Marine biomes are those that are found in saltwater environments, such as oceans and seas. These biomes cover more than 70% of the Earth&apos;s surface and are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species, including coral reefs, fish, and whales.</p>
        <p>One of the most important features of marine biomes is the presence of coral reefs. These unique ecosystems are home to a diverse range of species and are essential for maintaining the health of the ocean. However, changes in climate and water quality can have a significant impact on the health of coral reefs, which can lead to the loss of biodiversity and the collapse of entire ecosystems.</p>
