      <h1>Grass Peas (<i lang="la">Lathyrus sativus</i>)</h1>
      <p><i lang="la">Lathyrus sativus</i>, commonly referred to as <strong>grass pea</strong>, is a hardy legume with significant nutritional and stress-adaptive traits. Grass peas are well suited to a range of climate and soil types and can thrive in both dry and waterlogged conditions. While underutilized, this species has gained attention recently due to its tolerance of a variety of abiotic stresses. Lathyrus sativus plants are short, bushy diploid annuals (2<var>n</var>=14), with blue, pink, or white flowers and green seedpods. Their seedpods are curved and flat and contain 3 to 5 white or grey-brown seeds (Kumar <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2013).</p>
      <section id="how-to-grow">
        <h2>How to Grow</h2>
        <p>While used mainly as food, forage, and livestock feed, grass pea can also be grown as an ornamental and used medicinally (Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). The most prominent grass pea production regions are in South Asia and East Africa, specifically Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Ethiopia (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). Total production of grass pea is estimated at 1.2 million tons on 1.5 million hectares. Ethiopian production recently increased in total land area as well as amount harvested (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). Bangladesh also followed this trend through the expansion of its total planted area in dry and flooded fields (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). While still a production center, Europe has mostly de-emphasized grass peas in favor of better-known crops like chickpeas (Grela <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2010).</p>
        <p>Grass peas are versatile in many ways through their ability to thrive in an extensive range of soil conditions, elevations, water levels, and other abiotic stresses (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019; Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). They are often grown as a summer crop in high altitudes as well as a winter crop at lower elevations (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019).</p>
        <p>Grass peas are most prominent in arid and semiarid regions where more common legumes are not as well suited. Their ability to do well in low water conditions and their adaptability to poor-quality soils makes them extremely attractive to impoverished farmers. Their morphological adaptative mechanisms to drought conditions include narrow leaves, winged stems, and a deep root system (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). Physiological adaptations include an elevated ability to adjust the plant&apos;s osmotic potential and the upregulation of antioxidant enzyme genes (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019).</p>
        <p>Waterlogging can be a problem in locations with monsoon climates. The influx of water into the soil blocks a root&apos;s access to oxygen and can lead to a crop doing poorly if left in stagnant water for too long before the field can drain (Smartt <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 1994). Farmers in Ethiopia use grass peas&apos; tolerance of this stress to their advantage, commonly growing it during their monsoon season in high clay-content soil prone to waterlogging (Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). This practice extends their growing season by several months on land that would probably not be used otherwise until after the monsoon season ends.</p>
        <p>In terms of soil, grass peas are relatively undemanding and are good nitrogen fixers (Smartt <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 1994). Grass peas have a high yield potential at low fertilization levels and hardy root systems that help them thrive in a broad range of soil types, from volcanic soils in Ethiopia to heavy clay soils in Bangladesh (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019; Grela <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2010). They are commonly used as an intercrop with wheat and rice, staple crops in the same regions (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). They do very well in crop rotations due to their ability to improve soil conditions, reduce disease incidence, and lessen weed growth (Grela <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2010). All these qualities reduce its cost of production.</p>

        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>Grass peas are a popular food across several continents in a wide range of dishes. Many countries in Europe, Africa, and South Asia have numerous ways to prepare and eat them. Cooking, boiling, roasting, making them into drinks or sauces, and even eating uncooked seeds are all common ways for them to be consumed (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019). Grass pea seeds are remarkably high in protein, at a content level of about 27%, compared to chickpeas (<i lang="la">Cicer arietinum</i>), which commonly have only about 18% protein content (Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). They are also strong sources of starch, fiber, and secondary metabolites. (Soren <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2015). Because of this, a substantial portion of grass peas&apos; major production regions uses them as a primary protein supplement in their diets (Kumar <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2013). However, as in many grain legumes, grass pea is deficient in the sulfur-containing amino acids cystine and methionine (Lambein <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2019).</p>
        <p>Grass peas are one of the hardiest but also most underutilized crops (Kumar <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2013). There are several reasons that help contribute to this underutilization, one of the main ones being an issue that can arise if grass peas are a population&apos;s major source of protein for an extended period of time (Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). If grass peas are more than 20% of a diet&apos;s protein content over a period of three consecutive months, it can lead to the development of a neurological disorder called <a href="#neurolathyrism">neurolathyrism</a>, due to the presence of the neuroexcitatory amino acid β-ODAP acid (Wiraguna <i lang="la">et al.</i>, 2020). A stigma against grass peas has developed because of this, despite their significant dietary advantages and tolerance to abiotic stress.</p>
        <section id="neurolathyrism">
          <h3>Neurolathyrism</h3>
          <p>The overemphasis of grass peas’ toxic properties stems from ancient Greece and India, where the overconsumption of its seeds and the neurological disorder were linked (Lambein et al., 2019). This has led to it being disregarded and underutilized despite its very positive tolerances and nutritional advantages (Lambein et al., 2019). There are several studies looking into reducing the concentration of β-ODAP acid to make grass peas safer to eat. Neurolathyrism is usually inflicted only on those who are unable to secure other sources of protein (Smartt et al., 1994). In most current socioeconomic situations, when grass peas are eaten as part of a balanced diet, the development of this disorder is virtually non-existent (Lambein et al., 2019).</p>
