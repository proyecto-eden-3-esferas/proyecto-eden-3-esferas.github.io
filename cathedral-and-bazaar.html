      <h1><cite>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</cite>, by Eric Raymond</h1>
      <p>In 1997 computer programmer Eric Raymond (the author of this article) proposed a new theory of open source in his paper <cite>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar.</cite> Raymond compared the centralization, secrecy, slow release tempo, and vertical management of traditional software development to a cathedral with its top-down hierarchal structure; the decentralization, transparency, openness, and peer networking of the Linux community he likened to a bazaar with its give-and-take negotiations. The paper advanced reasons that the bazaar-like distributed approach to software development could be expected to yield higher-quality software.</p>
      <p>Where Stallman had framed his argument primarily in moral terms (<q>information needs to be free</q>), Raymond spoke in terms of engineering, rational choice, and market economics. He summed up his argument with this maxim: <q>Given a sufficiently large number of eyeballs, all [computer] bugs are shallow.</q> In early 1998 Raymond proposed the term open source as a description of the same community practices that Stallman had previously promoted under the free software phrase. With Raymond&apos;s proposal—and replacement of the label free—came a new program of outreach to corporations and the media.</p>
      <p>Under the open-source banner, the movement made huge strides during the “dot-com boom” of 1998–2000, and it kept those gains in the stock market bust that followed. By 2003 early doubts about whether open source could be the basis for a viable business model had been largely resolved. The open-source community&apos;s commercial partners included both midsized firms with community roots (such as Red Hat Software, Inc.) and large corporations (such as IBM and the Hewlett-Packard Company) intent on capturing the efficiencies and marketing pull of open source.</p>
      <p>In the new climate, governments in the United States and around the world began to question the wisdom of relying on proprietary code, which they could neither examine nor modify. Open-source advocates argued, with some success, that reliance on proprietary software could leave governments open to dangerous security breaches that software providers might be slow to fix. In contrast, they argued that the independent scrutiny of open-source programs offered the most effective possible audit. More political pressure developed when governments outside the United States began to wonder why they were paying large licensing fees to foreign corporations, especially when open source would make it possible to localize software for language communities too small for those foreign corporations to invest in serving.</p>
      <p>In Raymond&apos;s view, the shift to open source is being forced by the failure of other software verification methods to scale up as software becomes more complex—a view that has moved from mere speculation to nearly conventional wisdom within the open-source community. There remains, however, some political tension in the community between free software purists and pragmatists, with the former sometimes insisting on an identity separate from the rest of the open-source movement. This fissure roughly parallels the split between GPL and non-copyleft licences such as BSD and MIT.</p>
      <p>Technically, the open-source community remains close to its UNIX roots. The largest and most important faction remains the development network around the <a target="_blank" href="linux.html">Linux operating system</a>, which is fast eclipsing older UNIX variants. Other prestigious and significant open-source projects include the Apache World Wide Web server, the Firefox Web browser, the Perl and Python computer languages, and Stallman&apos;s Emacs editor.</p>
      <p>While Stallman, Torvalds, and Raymond have been relatively reluctant to discuss the application of open-source principles outside of software, others have been inspired by them. Wikipedia, a free, user-edited online encyclopaedia, was founded in explicit imitation of the open-source programming movement, as was the
      <a target="_blank" href="open-science.html">open publications</a> movement in the sciences and the open genomics movement in bioinformatics. The influence of open-source programming philosophy (and the code it has built) is pervasive in Web-based social networking sites such as eBay, Amazon, LiveJournal, and MySpace, where comments and product reviews are an essential feature of their commercial success and popularity. Perhaps most significant for future economic development around the world, visionaries are seeking ways to harness the <q>many-eyeballs effect</q> with networked organizations that emulate the observed structure of open-source software development teams.</p>
