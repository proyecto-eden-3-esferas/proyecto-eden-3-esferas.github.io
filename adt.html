      <h1>Abstract Data Types (ADTs)</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p>In computer science, an <dfn>abstract data type</dfn> (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. This mathematical model contrasts with <dfn>data structures</dfn>, which are concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer, not a user. For example, a stack has push/pop operations that follow a Last-In-First-Out rule, and can be concretely implemented using either a list or an array. Another example is a set which stores values, without any particular order, and no repeated values. Values themselves are not retrieved from sets; rather, one tests a value for membership to obtain a Boolean <q>in</q> or <q>not in</q>.</p>
        <p>ADTs are a theoretical concept, used in formal semantics and program verification and, less strictly, in the design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, and software systems. Most mainstream computer languages do not directly support formally specifying ADTs. However, various language features correspond to certain aspects of implementing ADTs, and are easily confused with ADTs proper; these include abstract types, opaque data types, protocols, and design by contract. For example, in modular programming, the module declares procedures that correspond to the ADT operations, often with comments that describe the constraints. This information hiding strategy allows the implementation of the module to be changed without disturbing the client programs, but the module only informally defines an ADT. The notion of abstract data types is related to the concept of data abstraction, important in object-oriented programming and design by contract methodologies for software engineering.</p>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <h2>Definition</h2>
        <p>Formally, an ADT is analogous to an algebraic structure in mathematics, consisting of a domain, a collection of operations, and a set of constraints the operations must satisfy. The domain is often defined implicitly, for example the free object over the set of ADT operations. The interface of the ADT typically refers only to the domain and operations, and perhaps some of the constraints on the operations, such as pre-conditions and post-conditions; but not to other constraints, such as relations between the operations, which are considered behavior.</p>

        <del>
        <p>There are two main styles of formal specifications for behavior, axiomatic semantics and operational semantics.</p>
        <p>Despite not being part of the interface, the constraints are still important to the definition of the ADT; for example a stack and a queue have similar add element/remove element interfaces, but it is the constraints that distinguish last-in-first-out from first-in-first-out behavior. The constraints do not consist only of equations such as fetch(store(S,v))=v but also logical formulas. </p>

        <p>Data types are used to define or classify the type of values a variable can store in it. Moreover, it also describes the possible operations allowed on those values. For example, the integer data type can store an integer value. Possible operations on an integer include addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulo.</p>
        <p>Abstract data type (ADT) is a concept or model of a data type. Because of ADT, a user doesn&apos;t have to bother about how that data type has been implemented. Moreover, ADT also takes care of the implementation of the functions on a data type. Here, the user will have predefined functions on each data type ready to use for any operation.</p>
        <p>Generally, in ADT, a user knows what to do without disclosing how to do it. These kinds of models are defined in terms of their data items and associated operations.</p>
        <p>In every programming language, we implement ADTs using different methods and logic. Although, we can still perform all the associated operations which are defined for that ADT irrespective of language. For example, in C, ADTs are implemented mostly using structure (<code>struct</code>). On the other hand, in C++ or JAVA, they&apos;re implemented using classes (<code>class</code>). However, operations are common in all languages.</p>
