        <h2>Occam&apos;s Razor</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p><dfn>Occam&apos;s razor</dfn> is a problem-solving principle that advises that when faced with competing explanations, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. It&apos;s a guideline, not a strict rule, suggesting that simpler explanations are more likely to be correct, according to the New Scientist and Britannica.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Here&apos;s a breakdown:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> When several explanations exist for a phenomenon, the simplest one (with the fewest assumptions) is usually / should be preferred.</li>
            <li><strong><q>Entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity</q>:</strong> This is the classical way to state the principle, according to <cite>Principia Cybernetica</cite> and <cite>Merriam-Webster</cite>.</li>
            <li><strong>Not a Guarantee</strong>: It&apos;s a <a target="_blank" href="ai.html#heuristics">heuristic</a>, a rule of thumb, not a definitive proof. It guides us towards the most likely explanation, but doesn&apos;t guarantee its correctness.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> If you hear hoofbeats, the simplest explanation is usually a horse, not a zebra, unless you&apos;re in an environment where zebras are common.</li>
            <li><strong>Application:</strong> Occam&apos;s razor is used in various fields, including science, medicine, and even computer science.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> What constitutes <q>simplicity</q> can be subjective and depend on context.</li>
            <li><strong><q>The simplest solution is usually the best</q>:</strong> This is a common way to summarize the principle.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2><cite>The Choice</cite>, by Eli Goldratt</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://claytondorge.com/reading">https://claytondorge.com/reading</a></cite>)</p>
        <p>This book connects the Theory of Constraints to living a full life.</p>
        <p>Goldratt argues that in order to live a full life we must be able to think clearly, which is simple but difficult in practice.</p>
        <p>The four obstacles that prevent us from thinking clearly are - 1) We see reality as complex, where we need to find the Inherent Simplicity, 2) We accept conflicts rather than attempting to remove them, 3) We blame situations on others behaviors instead of looking for explanations, and 4) We think <q>we know</q>, rather than challenging our own assumptions.</p>
        <blockquote>we face two alternatives: one is to bitch about reality and the other is to harvest the gift it just gave us, the knowledge of what has to be corrected...Freedom of Choice</blockquote>
        <blockquote>when we are involved in a situation that is handled as a win-lose situation, we will be more protective than generous. And when we are not satisfied with the end result we'll naturally blame the one that pushed us into that unsatisfactory situation; we'll blame the other side.</blockquote>

        <h2><i lang="fr">Pensée unique</i></h2>
        <p>"Pensée unique" (French pronunciation: [pɑ̃se ynik]；French for "single thought") is a pejorative expression for mainstream ideological conformism of any kind, almost always opposed to that of the speaker. Originally, it is a French expression and referred to claims that neoliberalism is the only correct way to structure society. The phrase implies that mainstream discussion is limited by ideological assumptions of what is possible. One example of pensée unique given by critics was TINA ("There is no alternative"), the motto of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The expression was coined by Jean-François Kahn, editor-in-chief of L'Événement du Jeudi,[1] in an editorial in January 1992. The phrase pensée unique is often used by political parties and organisations and in criticism. The term has been used regarding prohibitionism of marijuana, with some commenters saying that pensée unique is a barrier to legalization.</p>
