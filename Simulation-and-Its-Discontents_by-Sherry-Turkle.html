      <h1>Simulation and Its Discontents, by Sherry Turkle</h1>
      <h2>How the simulation and visualization technologies so pervasive in science, engineering, and design have changed our way of seeing the world.</h2>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Over the past twenty years, the technologies of simulation and visualization have changed our ways of looking at the world. In <cite>Simulation and Its Discontents</cite>, Sherry Turkle examines the now dominant medium of our working lives and finds that simulation has become its own sensibility. We hear it in Turkle&apos;s description of architecture students who no longer design with a pencil, of science and engineering students who admit that computer models seem more <q>real</q> than experiments in physical laboratories.</p>
        <p>Echoing architect Louis Kahn&apos;s famous question, <q>What does a brick want?</q>, Turkle asks, <q>What does simulation want?</q> Simulations want, even demand, immersion, and the benefits are clear. Architects create buildings unimaginable before virtual design; scientists determine the structure of molecules by manipulating them in virtual space; physicians practice anatomy on digitized humans. But immersed in simulation, we are vulnerable. There are losses as well as gains. Older scientists describe a younger generation as <q>drunk with code.</q> Young scientists, engineers, and designers, full citizens of the virtual, scramble to capture their mentors&apos; tacit knowledge of buildings and bodies. From both sides of a generational divide, there is anxiety that in simulation, something important is slipping away. Turkle&apos;s examination of simulation over the past twenty years is followed by four in-depth investigations of contemporary simulation culture: space exploration, oceanography, architecture, and biology.</p>
