      <h1>Bullshit Jobs: A Theory, by David Graeber</h1>
      <p> Does your job make a meaningful contribution to the world? In the spring of 2013, David Graeber asked this question in a playful, provocative essay titled <cite>On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</cite>. It went viral. After one million online views in seventeen different languages, people all over the world are still debating the answer.</p>
      <p>There are hordes of people—HR consultants, communication coordinators, telemarketing researchers, corporate lawyers—whose jobs are useless, and, tragically, they know it. These people are caught in bullshit jobs. Graeber taxonomizes pointless busywork: the administrative assistant with time to watch YouTube all day; the PR consultant who writes reports that nobody reads; the subcontractor who drives hundreds of miles to move a client&apos;s computer a few feet; the museum guard eternally watching an empty room.</p>
      <p>Graeber explores one of society&apos;s most vexing and deeply felt concerns, indicting among other villains a particular strain of finance capitalism that betrays ideals shared by thinkers ranging from Keynes to Lincoln. <q>Clever and charismatic.</q></p>
      <p>Bullshit Jobs gives individuals, corporations, and societies permission to undergo a shift in values, placing creative and caring work at the center of our culture.</p>
      <p>This book is for everyone who wants to turn their vocation back into an avocation and <q>a thought-provoking examination of our working lives</q> (<cite>Financial Times</cite>).</p>
