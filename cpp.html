      <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax. Besides being based on C, C++ is object-oriented, gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</p>
      <p>Like C, C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
      <aside>
        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <p>Bjarne Stroustrup invented C++ in 1979 to extend C, a procedural programming language. It was designed to offer programmers more control over memory and system resources.</p>
      </aside>

      <hr/>

      <p>One reason why C++ is so effective is its ability to work very closely with hardware. Additionally, as an object-oriented programming language, it offers flexibility in development. This makes it the go-to language when speed and performance are non-negotiable.</p>

      <h2>What is C plus-plus used for?</h2>
      <p>Over time, C++ has become a choice language for building fast and reliable software. Its versatility makes it an excellent match for complex applications, embedded systems, and internet of things (IoT) devices. A few of its most common use cases are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Software engineering.</strong> A couple of applications you might use daily that were created with C plus-plus include Netflix and Amazon.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating system (OS) development</strong> Examples of OS that were created with C++ include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and iOS.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical user interfaces</strong> C++ is often recommended for graphical user interface design or, GUI.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual reality (VR)</strong> C++ can be an excellent language to learn if you want to develop VR applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Blockchain technology</strong> The well-known cryptocurrency Bitcoin was developed in C++. It can also be used to create smart contracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Game development</strong> You can develop games and gaming consoles with C++. For example, the game World of Warcraft and the Xbox console.</li>
      </ul>
