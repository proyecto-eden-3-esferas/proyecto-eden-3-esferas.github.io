      <h1>Why AI Black Boxes Matter</h1>

      <p>In many cases, there is good reason to be wary of black box machine-learning algorithms and models. Suppose a machine-learning model has made a diagnosis about your health. Would you want the model to be black box or glass box? What about the physician prescribing your course of treatment? Perhaps she would like to know how the model arrived at its decision.</p>
      <p>What if a machine-learning model that determines whether you qualify for a business loan from a bank turns you down? Wouldn&apos;t you like to know why? If you did, you could more effectively appeal the decision, or change your situation to increase your chances of getting a loan the next time.</p>

      <p>Black boxes also have important implications for software system security. For years, many people in the computing field thought that keeping software in a black box would prevent hackers from examining it and therefore it would be secure. This assumption has largely been proved wrong because hackers can reverse-engineer software – that is, build an analog by closely observing how a piece of software works – and discover vulnerabilities to exploit.</p>
      <p>If software is in a glass box, then software testers and well-intentioned hackers can examine it and inform the creators of weaknesses, thereby minimizing cyberattacks.</p>
