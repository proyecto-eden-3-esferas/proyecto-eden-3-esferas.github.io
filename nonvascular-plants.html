      <h1>Nonvascular Plants</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Definition of the category</h2>
        <p>Informally known as <q>bryophytes</q>, <dfn>nonvascular plants</dfn> lack specialized vascular tissue (xylem and phloem) for internal water and food conduction and support. They also do not possess true roots, stems, or leaves. Some larger mosses, however, contain a central core of elongated thick-walled cells called <dfn>hydroids</dfn> that are involved in water conduction and that have been compared to the xylem elements of other plants. Bryophytes are second in diversity only to the flowering plants (angiosperms) and are generally regarded as composed of three divisions: Bryophyta (the mosses), Marchantiophyta (the liverworts), and Anthocerotophyta (the hornworts).</p>
        <p>Because bryophytes generally lack conducting cells and a well-developed cuticle that would limit dehydration, they depend on their immediate surroundings for an adequate supply of moisture. As a result, most bryophytes live in moist or wet shady locations, growing on rocks, trees, and soil. Some, however, have become adapted to totally aquatic habitats; others have become adapted to alternately wet and dry environments by growing during wet periods and becoming dormant during dry intervals. Although bryophytes are widely distributed, occurring in practically all parts of the world, none are found in salt water. Ecologically, some mosses are considered pioneer plants because they can invade bare areas.</p>
        <p>Bryophytes are typically land plants but seldom attain a height of more than a few centimetres. They possess the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll (both a and b forms) and carotenoids in cell organelles called chloroplasts. The life histories of these plants show a well-defined alternation of generations, with the independent and free-living gametophyte as the dominant photosynthetic phase in the life cycle. (This is in contrast to the vascular plants, in which the dominant photosynthetic phase is the sporophyte.) The sporophyte generation develops from, and is almost entirely parasitic on, the gametophyte. The gametophyte produces multicellular sex organs (<dfn>gametangia</dfn>). Female gametangia are called <dfn>archegonia</dfn>; male gametangia, <dfn>antheridia</dfn>. At maturity, archegonia each contain one egg, and antheridia produce many sperm cells. Because the egg is retained and fertilized within the archegonium, the early stages of the developing sporophyte are protected and nourished by the gametophytic tissue. The young undifferentiated sporophyte is called an <dfn>embryo</dfn>. Although bryophytes have become adapted to life on land, an apparent vestige of their aquatic ancestry is that the motile (flagellated) sperm depend on water to allow gamete transport and fertilization.</p>
        <p>Bryophytes are widely believed to have evolved from complex green algae that invaded land around 500 million years ago. Bryophytes share some traits with green algae, such as motile sperm, similar photosynthetic pigments, and the general absence of vascular tissue. However, bryophytes have multicellular reproductive structures, whereas those of green algae are unicellular, and bryophytes are mostly terrestrial and have complex plant bodies, whereas the green algae are primarily aquatic and have less-complex forms.</p>

          <h3>Division Bryophyta</h3>
          <p>Moss is a term erroneously applied to many different plants (Spanish moss, a flowering plant; Irish moss, a red alga; pond moss, filamentous algae; and reindeer moss, a lichen). True mosses are classified as the division Bryophyta.</p>
          <p>The moss gametophyte possesses leaflike structures (phyllids) that usually are a single cell layer thick, have a costa (midrib), and are spirally arranged on a stemlike axis (caulid). The moss gametophyte is an independent plant and is the familiar, erect <q>leafy</q> shoot. Multicellular rhizoids anchor the gametophyte to the substrate. The sporophyte plant develops from the tip of the fertile leafy shoot. After repeated cell divisions, the young sporophyte (embryo) transforms into a mature sporophyte consisting of foot, elongate seta, and capsule. The capsule is often covered by a calyptra, which is the enlarged remains of the archegonium. The capsule is capped by an operculum (lid), which falls off, exposing a ring of teeth (the peristome) that regulates the dispersal of spores.</p>

          <h3>Division Marchantiophyta</h3>
          <p><dfn class="firstterm">Liverworts</dfn>, the second major division of nonvascular plants, are found in the same types of habitat as mosses, and species of the two classes are often intermingled on the same site. The curious name liverwort is a relic of the medieval belief in the <q>doctrine of signatures,</q> which held that the external form of a plant provided a clue to which diseased body organ could be cured by a preparation made from that particular plant. There are two types of liverworts (also called hepatics) based on reproductive features and thallus structure. The more numerous <em>leafy</em> liverworts superficially resemble mosses, but most notably differ in having lobed or divided leaves that are without a midrib and are positioned in three rows. Thalloid (thallose) liverworts have a ribbonlike, or strap-shaped, body that grows flat on the ground. They have a high degree of internal structural differentiation into photosynthetic and storage zones. Liverwort gametophytes have unicellular rhizoids. Liverworts have an alternation of generations similar to that of mosses, and, as with mosses, the gametophyte generation is dominant. The sporophytes, however, are not microscopic and are often borne on specialized structures. They sometimes resemble small umbrellas and are called antheridiophores and archegoniophores.</p>

          <h3>Division Anthocerotophyta</h3>
          <p>The third division of bryophytes comprises the <dfn class="firstterm">hornworts</dfn>, a minor group numbering fewer than 100 species. The gametophyte is a small ribbonlike thallus that resembles a thallose liverwort. The name hornwort is derived from the unique slender, upright sporophytes, which are about 3–4 cm (1.2–1.6 inches) long at maturity and dehisce longitudinally into two valves that twist in response to changing humidity, thereby releasing spores in small numbers over a fairly long period of time.</p>
