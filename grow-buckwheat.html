      <h1>How to Grow Buckwheat (<i lang="la">Fagopyrum esculentum</i>)</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>herbaceous plant of the family <i lang="la">Polygonaceae</i> and its edible seeds. Buckwheat is a staple pseudograin crop in some parts of eastern Europe, where the hulled kernels, or <dfn>groats</dfn>, are prepared as kasha, cooked and served much like rice. While buckwheat flour is unsatisfactory for bread, it is used, alone or mixed with wheat flour, to make griddle cakes called buckwheat cakes in the United States and Canada. Buckwheat is high in carbohydrates and protein and provides small amounts of vitamins B1 and B2.</p>
        <p>A related species known as green buckwheat (<i lang="la">Fagopyrum tataricum</i>) is used similarly and is chiefly cultivated in East Asia.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Buckwheat is a fast-growing annual. The simple leaves are heart-shaped and borne along reddish hollow stems. The white flowers are produced in terminal clusters and are pollinated by bees and other insects. The kernels of the triangular-shaped seeds are enclosed by a tough dark brown or gray rind.</p>

        <aside>
          <p><strong>Is buckwheat gluten-free?</strong></p>
          <p>Yes. Buckwheat is naturally gluten-free, despite the fact that it has <q>wheat</q> in its name. Buckwheat and wheat are from two different botanical families. Believe it or not, buckwheat is related to <a target="_blank" href="grow-rhubarb.html">rhubarb</a>!</p>

        <h2>How to Grow Buckwheat</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Buckwheat is less productive than true grain crops on good soils but is particularly adapted to arid hilly land and cool climates. Because it matures quickly, it can be grown as a late-season crop. Buckwheat flowers provide both pollen and nectar for bees and can be used as a common honey crop. The plants improve conditions for the cultivation of other crops by smothering weeds and fostering beneficial insects and may be planted as a green manure crop that is plowed under to improve the soil. It is often used as a feed for poultry and other livestock, and in England it is considered especially suitable for feeding pheasants.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>To grow and harvest buckwheat, plant seeds from late spring to late summer, ideally in well-prepared, moderately fertile soil. Harvest when about three-quarters of the seeds have turned brown by cutting the plants close to the ground. After drying the plants, thresh the seeds by beating them with a broom or flail, then clean them by winnowing or sieving to remove chaff and store in airtight containers.</p>

          <h3>How to plant buckwheat seeds</h3>
          <p>Buckwheat seeds are a dark brown color, kind of triangular seeds, about 1/8′ across. I purchase mine at the health food store in their bulk section.</p>
          <p>You don&apos;t need to manually plant buckwheat seeds in rows or holes or whatnot. I simply scatter buckwheat over a raked, weed-free bed; it won&apos;t outcompete aggressive weeds. Maintain steady moisture, watering a couple of times a day if necessary to keep the seeds damp.</p>
          <p>Germination will happen in the first week, with round leaves emerging from the soil. Note that buckwheat seeds can be grown and harvested as microgreens, too!</p>
          <p>Buckwheat cycles through its growth process quickly, going from seed to flower in six weeks, ending its life cycle by producing more seeds in just 13 weeks. Note that buckwheat thrives in full sun and does not like overly shaded areas.</p>

            <h3>7 Good Reasons for Growing Buckwheat in Your Garden</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><p><strong>Planting buckwheat deters pests</strong></p>
                  <p>Scattered alongside newly sprouted vegetable seeds or starts, the buckwheat seeds quickly take root, reaching their 12-15″ (35cm) height in just a couple of weeks.</p>
                  <p>Flying pests find it difficult to maneuver through the lush growth of the buckwheat plants to reach their intended target. What this has meant in my garden is that cabbage moths can&apos;t lay eggs on my kale plants (image below), giving them a chance to get established before they outgrow the buckwheat. I&apos;m hoping that similar holds true as my summer squash starts to bloom.</p>
              </li>
              <li><p><strong>Growing buckwheat plants to attract beneficial insects</strong></p></li>
              <li><p><strong>It makes great animal fodder</strong></p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Buckwheat is edible</strong></p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Buckwheat reseeds itself</strong></p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Growing buckwheat plants as a green manure crop</strong></p>
                  <p>If you want to juice up your soil health, scatter seeds on a fallow garden bed or planting area. When it&apos;s about a foot high, use the <strong>chop and drop</strong> method or till it in.</p>
                  <p>It&apos;s also great at extracting phosphorus from insoluble sources, so planting buckwheat helps to improve the soil.</p>
              </li>
              <li><p><strong>Buckwheat keeps weeds at bay</strong></p>
                  <p>It grows so quickly that the plants shade out many weeds before they have a chance to take hold.</p>
