      <h1>Types of Fruits</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(Mostly from the <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fruit-plant-reproductive-body">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a></cite>)</p>
      <p>The concept of <q>fruit</q> is based on such an odd mixture of practical and theoretical considerations that it accommodates cases in which one flower gives rise to several fruits (larkspur) as well as cases in which several flowers cooperate in producing one fruit (mulberry). Pea and bean plants, exemplifying the simplest situation, show in each flower a single pistil (female structure), traditionally thought of as a megasporophyll or carpel. The carpel is believed to be the evolutionary product of an originally leaflike organ bearing ovules along its margin. This organ was somehow folded along the median line, with a meeting and coalescing of the margins of each half, the result being a miniature closed but hollow pod with one row of ovules along the suture. In many members of the rose and buttercup families, each flower contains a number of similar single-carpelled pistils, separate and distinct, which together represent what is known as an apocarpous gynoecium. In other cases, two to several carpels (still thought of as megasporophylls, although perhaps not always justifiably) are assumed to have fused to produce a single compound gynoecium (pistil), whose basal part, or ovary, may be uniloculate (with one cavity) or pluriloculate (with several compartments), depending on the method of carpel fusion.</p>
      <p>Most fruits develop from a single pistil. A fruit resulting from the apocarpous gynoecium (several pistils) of a single flower may be referred to as an aggregate fruit. A multiple fruit represents the gynoecia of several flowers. When additional flower parts, such as the stem axis or floral tube, are retained or participate in fruit formation, as in the apple or strawberry, an accessory fruit results.</p>
      <p>Certain plants, mostly cultivated varieties, spontaneously produce fruits in the absence of pollination and fertilization; such natural parthenocarpy leads to seedless fruits such as bananas, oranges, grapes, and cucumbers. Since 1934, seedless fruits of tomato, cucumber, peppers, holly, and others have been obtained for commercial use by administering plant growth substances, such as indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid, naphthalene acetic acid, and β-naphthoxyacetic acid, to the ovaries in flowers (induced parthenocarpy).</p>
      <p>Classification systems for mature fruits take into account the number of carpels constituting the original ovary, dehiscence (opening) versus indehiscence, and dryness versus fleshiness. The properties of the ripened ovary wall, or pericarp, which may develop entirely or in part into fleshy, fibrous, or stony tissue, are important. Often three distinct pericarp layers can be identified: the outer (exocarp), the middle (mesocarp), and the inner (endocarp). All purely morphological systems (i.e., classification schemes based on structural features) are artificial. They ignore the fact that fruits can be understood only functionally and dynamically.</p>

      <p>There are two broad categories of fruits: <strong>fleshy fruits</strong>, in which the pericarp and accessory parts develop into succulent tissues, as in eggplants, oranges, and strawberries; and dry fruits, in which the entire pericarp becomes dry at maturity. Fleshy fruits include (1) the <dfn>berries</dfn>, such as tomatoes, blueberries, and cherries, in which the entire pericarp and the accessory parts are succulent tissue, (2) <dfn>aggregate fruits</dfn>, such as blackberries and strawberries, which form from a single flower with many pistils, each of which develops into fruitlets, and (3) <dfn>multiple fruits</dfn>, such as pineapples and mulberries, which develop from the mature ovaries of an entire inflorescence. Dry fruits include the legumes, cereal grains, capsulate fruits, and nuts.</p>
      <p>As strikingly exemplified by the word <strong>nut</strong>, popular terms often do not properly describe the botanical nature of certain fruits. A Brazil nut, for example, is a thick-walled seed enclosed in a likewise thick-walled capsule along with several sister seeds. A coconut is a drupe (a stony-seeded fruit) with a fibrous outer part. A walnut is a drupe in which the pericarp has differentiated into a fleshy outer husk and an inner hard <q>shell</q>; the <q>meat</q> represents the seed—two large convoluted cotyledons, a minute epicotyl and hypocotyl, and a thin papery seed coat. A peanut is an indehiscent legume fruit. An almond is a drupe <q>stone</q>; i.e., the hardened endocarp usually contains a single seed. Botanically speaking, blackberries and raspberries are not true berries but aggregates of tiny drupes. A juniper <q>berry</q> is not a fruit at all but the cone of a gymnosperm. A mulberry is a multiple fruit made up of small nutlets surrounded by fleshy sepals. And strawberry represents a much-swollen receptacle (the tip of the flower stalk bearing the flower parts) bearing on its convex surface an aggregation of tiny brown achenes (small single-seeded fruits).</p>

        <h2>Dispersal of Fruits</h2>
        <p>Fruits play an important role in the seed dispersal of many plant species. In dehiscent fruits, such as poppy capsules, the seeds are usually dispersed directly from the fruits, which may remain on the plant. In fleshy or indehiscent fruits, the seeds and fruit are commonly moved away from the parent plant together. In many plants, such as grasses and lettuce, the outer integument and ovary wall are completely fused, so seed and fruit form one entity; such seeds and fruits can logically be described together as <q>dispersal units,</q> or diaspores. For further discussion on seed dispersal, see seed: <cite>agents of dispersal</cite>.</p>
        <section id="animal-dispersal">
          <h3>Animal dispersal</h3>
          <p>A wide variety of animals aid in the dispersal of seeds, fruits, and diaspores. Many birds and mammals, ranging in size from mice and kangaroo rats to elephants, act as dispersers when they eat fruits and diaspores. In the tropics, chiropterochory (dispersal by large bats such as flying foxes, <i lang="la">Pteropus</i>) is particularly important. Fruits adapted to these animals are relatively large and drab in colour with large seeds and a striking (often rank) odour. Such fruits are accessible to bats because of the pagoda-like structure of the tree canopy, fruit placement on the main trunk, or suspension from long stalks that hang free of the foliage. Examples include mangoes, guavas, breadfruit, carob, and several fig species. In South Africa a desert melon (<i lang="la">Cucumis humifructus</i>) participates in a symbiotic relationship with aardvarks—the animals eat the fruit for its water content and bury their own dung, which contains the seeds, near their burrows.</p>
          <p>Additionally, furry terrestrial mammals are the agents most frequently involved in epizoochory, the inadvertent carrying by animals of dispersal units. Burlike fruits, or those diaspores provided with spines, hooks, claws, bristles, barbs, grapples, and prickles, are genuine hitchhikers, clinging tenaciously to their carriers. Their functional shape is achieved in various ways: in cleavers, or goose grass (<i lang="la">Galium aparine</i>), and in enchanter&apos;s nightshade (<i lang="la">Circaea lutetiana</i>), the hooks are part of the fruit itself; in common agrimony (<i lang="la">Agrimonia eupatoria</i>), the fruit is covered by a persistent calyx (the sepals, parts of the flower, which remain attached beyond the usual period) equipped with hooks; and in wood avens (<i lang="la">Geum urbanum</i>), the persistent styles have hooked tips. Other examples are bur marigolds, or beggar&apos;s-ticks (Bidens species); buffalo bur (<i lang="la">Solanum rostratum</i>); burdock (<i lang="la">Arctium</i>); <i lang="la">Acaena</i>; and many <i lang="la">Medicago</i> species. The last-named, with dispersal units highly resistant to damage from hot water and certain chemicals (dyes), have achieved wide global distribution through the wool trade. A somewhat different principle is employed by the so-called trample burrs, said to lodge themselves between the hooves of large grazing mammals. Examples are mule grab (<i lang="la">Proboscidea</i>) and the African grapple plant (<i lang="la">Harpagophytum</i>). In water burrs, such as those of the water chestnut <i lang="la">Trapa</i>, the spines should probably be considered as anchoring devices.</p>
          <p>Birds, being preening animals, rarely carry burlike diaspores on their bodies. They do, however, transport the very sticky (viscid) fruits of <i lang="la">Pisonia</i>, a tropical tree of the four-o&apos;clock family, to distant Pacific islands in this way. Small diaspores, such as those of sedges and certain grasses, may also be carried in the mud sticking to waterfowl and terrestrial birds.</p>
          <p><dfn>Synzoochory</dfn>, deliberate carrying of diaspores by animals, is practiced when birds carry diaspores in their beaks. The European mistle thrush (<i lang="la">Turdus viscivorus</i>) deposits the viscid seeds of mistletoe (<i lang="la">Viscum album</i>) on potential host plants when, after a meal of the berries, it whets its bill on branches or simply regurgitates the seeds. The North American (<i lang="la">Phoradendron</i>) and Australian (<i lang="la">Amyema</i>) mistletoes are dispersed by various birds, and the comparable tropical species of the plant family <i lang="la">Loranthaceae</i> by flower-peckers (of the bird family <i lang="la">Dicaeidae</i>), which have a highly specialized gizzard that allows seeds to pass through but retains insects. Plants may also profit from the forgetfulness and sloppy habits of certain nut-eating birds that cache part of their food but neglect to recover everything or that drop units on their way to a hiding place. Best known in this respect are the nutcrackers (<i lang="la">Nucifraga</i>), which feed largely on the <q>nuts</q> of beech, oak, walnut, chestnut, and hazelnut; the jays (<i lang="la">Garrulus</i>), which hide hazelnuts and acorns; the nuthatches; and the California woodpecker (<i lang="la">Melanerpes formicivorus</i>), which may embed literally thousands of acorns, almonds, and pecan nuts in bark fissures or holes of trees. Rodents may aid in dispersal by stealing the embedded diaspores and burying them. In Germany, an average jay may transport about 4,600 acorns per season, over distances of up to 4 km (2.5 miles).</p>
          <p>Most <dfn>ornithochores</dfn> (plants with bird-dispersed seeds) have conspicuous diaspores attractive to such fruit-eating birds as thrushes, pigeons, barbets (members of the bird family <i lang="la">Capitonidae</i>), toucans (family <i lang="la">Ramphastidae</i>), and hornbills (family <i lang="la">Bucerotidae</i>), all of which either excrete or regurgitate the hard part undamaged. Such diaspores have a fleshy, sweet, or oil-containing edible part; a striking colour (often red or orange); no pronounced smell; protection against being eaten prematurely, in the form of acids and tannins that are present only in the green fruit; protection of the seed against digestion, afforded by bitterness, hardness, or the presence of poisonous compounds; permanent attachment; and, finally, absence of a hard outer cover. In contrast to bat-dispersed diaspores, they occupy no special position on the plant. Examples are rose hips, plums, dogwood fruits, barberry, red currant, mulberry, nutmeg fruits, figs, blackberries, and others. The natural and abundant occurrence of <i lang="la">Euonymus</i>, which is a largely tropical genus, in temperate Europe and Asia, can be understood only in connection with the activities of birds. Birds also contributed substantially to the repopulation with plants of the Krakatoa island group in Indonesia after the catastrophic volcanic eruption there in 1883. Birds have made <i lang="la">Lantana</i> (originally American) a pest in Indonesia and Australia; the same is true of black cherries (<i lang="la">Prunus serotina</i>) in parts of Europe, <i lang="la">Rubus</i> species in Brazil and New Zealand, and olives (<i lang="la">Olea europaea</i>) in Australia.</p>
          <p>Many intact fruits and seeds can serve as fish bait—those of <i lang="la">Sonneratia</i>, for example, for the catfish <i lang="la">Arius maculatus</i>. Certain Amazon River fishes react positively to the audible <q>explosions</q> of the ripe fruits of <i lang="la">Eperua rubiginosa</i>. The largest freshwater wetlands in the world, found in Brazil&apos;s Pantanal, become inundated with seasonal floods at a time when many plants are releasing their fruits. Pacu fish (<i lang="la">Metynnis</i>) feed on submerged and floating fruits and disperse the seeds when they defecate. It is thought that at least one plant species (<i lang="la">Bactris glaucescens</i>) relies exclusively on pacu for seed dispersal.</p>
          <p>Fossil evidence indicates that <dfn>saurochory</dfn>, dispersal by reptiles, is very ancient. The giant Galapagos tortoise is important for the dispersal of local cacti and tomatoes, and iguanas are known to eat and disperse a number of smaller fruits, including the iguana hackberry (<i lang="la">Celtis iguanaea</i>). The name alligator apple, for <i lang="la">Annona glabra</i>, refers to its method of dispersal, an example of saurochory.</p>

        <section id="wind-dispersal">
          <h3>Wind dispersal</h3>
          <p>Winged fruits are most common in trees and shrubs, such as maple, ash, elm, birch, alder, and dipterocarps (a family of about 600 species of Old World tropical trees). The one-winged propeller type, as found in maple, is called a <dfn>samara</dfn>. When fruits have several wings on their sides, rotation may result, as in rhubarb and dock species. Sometimes accessory parts form the wings—for example, the bracts (small green leaflike structures that grow just below flowers) in linden (<i lang="la">Tilia</i>).</p>
          <p>Many fruits form plumes, some derived from persisting and ultimately hairy styles, as in clematis, avens, and anemones; some from the perianth, as in the sedge family (<i lang="la">Cyperaceae</i>); and some from the <dfn>pappus</dfn>, a calyx structure, as in dandelion and Jack-go-to-bed-at-noon (<i lang="la">Tragopogon</i>). In woolly fruits and seeds, the pericarp or the seed coat is covered with cottonlike hairs—e.g., willow, poplar or cottonwood, cotton, and balsa. In some cases, the hairs may serve double duty in that they function in water dispersal as well as in wind dispersal.</p>
          <p>Poppies have a mechanism in which the wind has to swing the slender fruitstalk back and forth before the seeds are thrown out through pores near the top of the capsule. The inflated indehiscent pods of <i lang="la">Colutea arborea</i>, a steppe plant, represent balloons capable of limited air travel before they hit the ground and become windblown tumbleweeds.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="other-dispersal">
          <h3>Other forms of dispersal</h3>
          <p><dfn>Geocarpy</dfn> is defined as either the production of fruits underground, as in the arum lilies (<i lang="la">Stylochiton</i> and <i lang="la">Biarum</i>), in which the flowers are already subterranean, or the active burying of fruits by the mother plant, as in the peanut (<i lang="la">Arachis hypogaea</i>). In the American hog peanut (<i lang="la">Amphicarpa bracteata</i>), pods of a special type are buried by the plant and are cached by squirrels later on. Kenilworth ivy (<i lang="la">Cymbalaria</i>), which normally grows on stone or brick walls, stashes its fruits away in crevices after strikingly extending the flower stalks. Not surprisingly, geocarpy is most often encountered in desert plants; however, it also occurs in violet species, in subterranean clover (<i lang="la">Trifolium subterraneum</i>), and in begonias (<i lang="la">Begonia hypogaea</i>) of the African rainforest.</p>
