	  <blockquote>
	    <p>Mature, well-made compost is fundamental to organic farming. It is a stable, slow-release fertilizer that builds up soil life and will not "burn" plants. Synthetic amendments and manure can provide soluble nutrients for plant growth but do not build the soil&apos;s long-term biological reserves as well as compost does.</p>
	    <p>When compost is properly managed, the result is the best soil amendment a farmer can use. Compost substantially increases the water holding capacity of the soil helping farmers to produce a good crop even in years of low rain. The addition of compost will keep the soil pH at levels crop plants prefer saving farmers the cost of lime and gypsum applications. Compost improves soil structure and stability, recycles nutrients, stabilizes volatile nitrogen, converts wastes into resources and suppresses soil-borne diseases. The composting process destroys weed seeds and pathogenic microorganisms, while beneficial microorganisms grow and multiply in great numbers. And soil microorganisms work non-stop to build structure and prevent erosion.</p>
	    <note>Because compost is alive with microbes, bacteria and fungi, the composting process continues even after compost is applied, breaking down raw materials and reassembling them into more-stable humus.</note>
	    <!-- <p>Despite the long and ancient history growers have had with compost, we are still far from perfecting the process. Rodale Institute has been making compost for decades and continues to research and refine best practices related to making and using this valuable resource.</p> -->

        <p>The compost is never left in an exposed pile. The compost is always collected only in bins and always covered. When someone piles organic material in an open pile, as was often done back when composting practices were first being developed (and is still done today in many places), the pile will stink, it will attract flies and it will need to be repeatedly turned. Open piles are usually not covered because then the surface area would too large and it would take too much cover material. Open piles have large surface to volume ratios (there is too much surface relative to volume). This means the internal heat of the pile is unavailable to a large amount of the organic material on the outer surfaces. These piles must be repeatedly <q>turned</q> so that the outside is turned inward, allowing all parts of the pile to be subjected to the internal temperatures. Turning is a very labor intensive process and totally unnecessary when containing the organic material in a covered bin. The notion that compost piles must be turned refers to the open piles, which is not what we&apos;re doing or recommending.</p>

        <h2>How To Build a Compost Bin</h2>
        <p>A simple compost bin is four pallets set on edge and tied together in a square. More permanent bins involve posts and boards. If the top of the compost is accessible to chickens, dogs, etc., it can be covered with wire mesh will prevent the compost from being disturbed. A square piece of loose wire fence is easily removed when adding compost to the pile. The compost bin itself can be built from pallets, scrap wood, wire mesh, stacked bales of hay or straw, other recycled materials, or even masonry materials such as block, brick or stone. Do not use lumber that is treated with chemicals.</p>
