      <h1>Black Boxes</h1>
      <p>In science, computing, and engineering, a <dfn>black box</dfn> is a model, device, system, or object which produces useful information without revealing any information about its internal workings. The explanations for its conclusions remain opaque or <q>black.</q> A black box can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is <q>opaque</q> (black). The term can be used to refer to many inner workings, such as those of an <a href="ic.html">integrated circuit</a>, an engine, an algorithm, or even the human brain.</p>
      <p>To analyze an <a href="open_system.html">open system</a> with a typical <strong>black box approach</strong>, only the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) box. The usual representation of this <q>black box system</q> is a data flow diagram centered in the box.</p>
      <p>Advances in computing power, artificial intelligence, and machine learning capabilities are causing a proliferation of black box models in many professions, and are adding to the mystique surrounding them.</p>
      <p>Black box models are eyed warily by potential users in many professions. As one physician writes in a paper about their uses in cardiology: <q>>Black box is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans.</q></p>

      <p>The opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a <dfn>white box</dfn> (sometimes also known as a <q>clear box</q> or a <q>glass box</q>).</p>
