      <h1>Organic Diversity</h1>
      <p><dfn>Diversity</dfn> is a sustainable principle. In the natural world, diversity of species is prevalent. Growing many types of basil in a garden sustains the life of basil on the planet. We have seen in America what happens when a virus takes hold of a single species of tree that is commonly grown in parks and towns. As an example, Dutch elm disease killed off elms across America, creating a significant impact.</p>
      <p>The principle of diversity recommends that gardeners include as many different plants as possible throughout the landscape, plant as many different species of one type of plant, and design a variety of different microclimates throughout your landscape. The goal is to provide food for as many different types of bees, beneficial insects, birds, hummingbirds and butterflies as possible. Plants native to the area are the easiest to grow, because they do not require fertilizer and can adjust to the changeable weather patterns.</p>
      <p>We know that wild creatures are frequently stuck in their ways, demanding to dine on only what they have been used to for eons. Many too often look for only specific flowers, shrubs or trees that are native to the area. They are looking for the nectar, seed, bug or nut of native plants that have been naturally living in their dining area for hundreds or even thousands of years. After all, it took time to evolve with the environment and to learn what worked for their survival and what didn&apos;t. Today, when the monarch butterfly can easily find a meadow-type garden to eat only various milkweeds, it will be happy and live a long life on the planet. If those meadow-type gardens are too far apart, that can be a serious issue for the monarch&apos;s survival.</p>
      <p>Diversity increases the appeal for both gardeners and wildlife. Butterflies and many beneficial insects are attracted to red, for example. If there are no red or orange flowers, the population of butterflies is going to be affected.</p>
      <p>Different types of plants need different types of nutrients to grow. Plants vary in the types of nutrients they pull out of the soil to feed other plants. The easiest way to have a landscape that can feed more wildlife is to offer a larger variety on their menu. For us, too, salads are more fun because today there are more kinds of lettuce and salad greens available.</p>
      <p>Another reason for diversity is to reduce the impact of pests on your garden. Many pests also like only specific plants. If there is a large variety of plants growing close together, the pest may literally have difficulty finding the plant it wants to devour. Strong-smelling herbs can confuse pests. If the pest takes longer to find its food, the better the chances are that a lizard, spider or bird will eat it.</p>
      <p>Another point to consider is that variety helps to hold diseases in check. The more different species you have in your landscape, including native plants, the more beneficial insects will take up residence. Diversity can also reduce negative effects from invasive plants by minimizing the influence of the invasion on the entire ecosystem. Quoting Jefferson, <quote>The greatest service which can be rendered any country is to add a useful plant to its culture. One such service of this kind rendered to a nation is worth more to them than all the victories of the most splendid pages of their history.</quote></p>
