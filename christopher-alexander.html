      <h1>Christopher Alexander</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Christopher Wolfgang John Alexander (4 October 1936 – 17 March 2022) was an Austrian-born British-American architect and design theorist... His theories about the nature of human-centered design have affected fields beyond architecture, including urban design, software design, and sociology...</p>
        <p>In software, Alexander is regarded as the father of the pattern language movement...</p>
        <p>... However, Alexander was controversial among some mainstream architects and critics, in part because his work was often harshly critical of much of contemporary architectural theory and practice.</p>
