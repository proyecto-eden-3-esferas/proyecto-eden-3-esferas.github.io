      <h1>Cuckooland: Where the Rich Own the Truth - Tom Burgis</h1>

      <p>Everywhere, the powerful are making a renewed claim to the greatest prize of all: to own the truth. The power to choose what you want reality to be and impose that reality on the world.</p>
      <p>For three years, Tom Burgis followed a lead that took him deeper and deeper into Cuckooland – the place where the rich own the truth. The trail snaked from the Kremlin to Kathmandu, Stockholm to the Steppe, from a blood-soaked town square in Uzbekistan to a royal retreat in Scotland. Burgis hunted down oligarchs, developed secret sources and traced vast sums of money flowing between multinational corporations, ex-Soviet dictators and the west&apos;s ruling elites. And he found one man who wanted the power to bend reality to his will.</p>
      <p>This book tells an astonishing story: a tale of secrets and lies that reveals how fragile that truth can be. Whether it&apos;s in Kazakh torture chambers or the UK&apos;s High Court, the lords of Cuckooland are seizing control of the truth. They decree what stories may be told about war and money and power, what we are permitted to know – and more importantly, what we are not.</p>
      <p>From the bestselling author of <cite>Kleptopia</cite>, <cite>Cuckooland</cite> is a deeply reported work of non-fiction that reads like a thriller. It is a story of how globalisation and technological revolution have combined to imperil the foundation of free societies: that the truth belongs to the many, not the few.</p>
