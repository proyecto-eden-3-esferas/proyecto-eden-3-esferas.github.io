      <h1>Photosynthesis</h1>
      <p>The autotrophic mode of nutrition of plants, is derived from oxygenic photosynthesis. Energy-rich organic compounds are synthesized from low-energy atmospheric <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var>, using the energy of absorbed sunlight. (Some bacteria are nonoxygenic photosynthesizers, utilizing hydrogen sulfide, H<sub>2</sub>S, rather than water.) The resultant organic compounds initiate the flow of energy and carbon through the food chains of managed and natural ecosystems, intrinsically linking plants with the heterotrophic life-forms of the remaining kingdoms of organisms. The oxygen liberated by plants (and certain photosynthetic protists and prokaryotes) over geologic time has oxygenated Earth&apos;s atmosphere and has produced fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil.</p>
      <p>The following sections describe the basic mechanisms of photosynthesis—the acquisition of energy and the fixation of carbon dioxide—used by plants of diverse evolutionary lines.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Basic mechanisms</h2>
        <p>Electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths between approximately 400 and 700 nanometres can be seen as light by the eye and constitutes the range absorbed by plants for photosynthesis. Blue light has a wavelength around 450 nanometres, and red light, a wavelength of 650–700 nanometres.</p>
        <p>Double-membraned cell organelles called chloroplasts contain the photosynthetic apparatus: light-absorbing pigments, other electron-carrying chemicals (cytochromes and quinones), and enzymes. (Pigments absorb light of a particular wavelength; those wavelengths that are not absorbed are reflected and may be perceived as colour—hence, for example, the green colour of many plants.) The inner membrane of the chloroplast is folded into flat tubes, the edges of which are joined to hollow sacklike disks called thylakoids. Stacks of thylakoids embedded with pigment molecules are called <dfn>grana</dfn>. The inner matrix of the chloroplast is called the <dfn>stroma</dfn>.</p>

        <p>Photosynthesis consists of two interdependent series of reactions, the light, or light-harvesting, reactions and the dark, or carbon-assimilating, reactions; the former are dependent on light, the latter on temperature. Light reactions occur in the grana and dark reactions in the stroma. The overall formula for photosynthesis is:</p>
        <blockquote class="informalequation">6CO<sub>2</sub> + 12H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O.</blockquote>
        <p>The light reactions, the first stage of photosynthesis, convert light energy into chemical energy (ATP and NADPH). Light reactions comprise two interdependent systems, called photosystems I and II. The dark reactions, the second stage of photosynthesis, use the chemical energy products of the light reactions to convert carbon from carbon dioxide to simple sugars.</p>

          <caption>The light reaction occurs in two photosystems (units of chlorophyll molecules). Light energy (indicated by wavy arrows) absorbed by photosystem II causes the formation of high-energy electrons, which are transferred along a series of acceptor molecules in an electron transport chain to photosystem I. Photosystem II obtains replacement electrons from water molecules, resulting in their split into hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms combine to form molecular oxygen (O2), which is released into the atmosphere. The hydrogen ions are released into the lumen. Additional hydrogen ions are pumped into the lumen by electron acceptor molecules. This creates a high concentration of ions inside the lumen. The flow of hydrogen ions back across the photosynthetic membrane provides the energy needed to drive the synthesis of the energy-rich molecule ATP. High-energy electrons, which are released as photosystem I absorbs light energy, are used to drive the synthesis of NADPH. Photosystem I obtains replacement electrons from the electron transport chain. ATP provides the energy and NADPH provides the hydrogen atoms needed to drive the subsequent photosynthetic dark reaction, or Calvin cycle.</caption>

        <p>Light reactions consist of several hundred light-absorbing pigment molecules arranged so as to maximize the gathering of light energy. These <q>antennae</q> are coupled to a mini-circuit of electron-carrying chemicals. The pigments are two types of chlorophyll—chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b—and various carotenoids. Absorbed light energy is transferred to specialized chlorophyll molecules called P700 and P680 in photosystems I and II, respectively. Once these specialized chlorophyll molecules have acquired sufficient energy, electrons are given up to the electron carriers within their photosystems, initiating an electron flow. (The carrier molecules include plastoquinones and cytochromes.) The effect of this, when photosystems I and II function synchronously, is the formation of a chemiosmotic gradient of protons that phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) ADP, resulting in ATP. Those electrons also lead to the formation of NADPH from NADP. The P680 chlorophyll, upon loss of its electron, becomes a strong oxidizing agent that subsequently causes the water molecule to dissociate into protons and oxygen gas.</p>
        <p>The dark reactions are responsible for the conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose. The essential reaction involves the combining of <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> with the five-carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) in a series of reactions called the Calvin-Benson cycle. This reaction yields an unstable six-carbon intermediate, which immediately breaks down into two molecules of phosphoglycerate (PGA), a three-carbon acid. Each reaction is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. Six revolutions of the cycle means that 6 <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> molecules react with 6 RuBP molecules to produce 12 molecules of PGA; 2 three-carbon PGA molecules combine to form the six-carbon glucose, and 10 PGAs are recycled to regenerate 6 molecules of RuBP. The ATP and NADPH from light reactions provide the energy and reducing power to form glucose and refurbish the <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> acceptor, RuBP.<!-- For further information about Melvin Calvin&apos;s work, see photosynthesis.--></p>
        <!--During the dark reaction (light-independent stage) of photosynthesis, sugars such as glucose are created from carbon dioxide and water using adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

        <h2>Specific variations in photosynthesis</h2>
        <p>Chlorophylls a and b (bound to proteins) and carotenoids constitute the principal light-absorbing complex of most plants. Differences in chloroplast structure, though not major, occur among phylogenetically diverse plant groups. All such variations, however, represent evolutionary adaptations to more efficiently utilize the light energy that drives the reactions common to all oxygenic photosynthesizers (i.e., photosystems I and II) or to avoid damage due to excessive light.</p>
        <p>The enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes the formation of organic molecules from <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var>. As the major enzyme of all photosynthetic cells, Rubisco is the most abundant protein on Earth. There is, however, a major catalytic flaw in the ability of this enzyme to convert <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> to sugars. In the presence of molecular oxygen, Rubisco also catalyzes a reaction in which oxygen is introduced (i.e., it acts as an oxygenase), and <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> is formed rather than converted.</p>
        <p>Rubisco evolved in photosynthetic organisms that lived in the atmosphere of primitive Earth, an atmosphere that contained only traces of molecular oxygen and plenty of carbon dioxide. As photosynthesis in the cyanobacteria of Precambrian times (about 4.6 billion years ago to 541 million years ago) oxygenated the atmosphere, the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen fell drastically, and Rubisco began to function more and more as an oxygenase. This greatly reduced the net fixation of <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> into sugars and, therefore, photosynthetic efficiency. Rubisco as an oxygenase splits RuBP into one PGA and a two-carbon acid phosphoglycolate, which initiates the photorespiratory carbon-oxidation cycle, or photorespiration. (This cycle probably evolved to recycle PGA back into the photosynthetic pathway, thereby preventing an even greater loss of carbon.) Photorespiration involves three organelles (chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria), each with unique transport mechanisms for the cycle&apos;s intermediates.</p>
        <p>All plants are classified as C3 (plants that use only the Calvin-Benson cycle), C4 (plants that use an additional <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var>-fixation mechanism and the Calvin-Benson cycle), C3-C4 (plants intermediate between C3 and C4), and CAM (plants that have a nocturnal variant of the C4 pathway).</p>
        <p>The majority of plants fix <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> directly into RuBP, and their first stable product is the three-carbon acid PGA—hence the designation C3. Those plants have an active photorespiratory cycle, especially at high temperatures.</p>
        <p>Sometime during the Oligocene Epoch (33.9 million to 23 million years ago), certain of the angiosperms (grasses and dicotyledonous plants) of mainly tropical climates evolved a <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var>-fixation system that acted ahead of the Calvin-Benson cycle. The first fixation is into the three-carbon acid phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP carboxylase (an enzyme that has no oxygenase function) in the outer mesophyll cells of the leaf. The first stable fixation product is the four-carbon acid oxaloacetate—hence the designation C4 plants. Oxaloacetate is reduced to malate, which is transferred to a thick-walled bundle sheath cell. Malate is decarboxylated, giving rise to high <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> concentrations in the bundle sheath. Here, Rubisco of the Calvin-Benson cycle functions more efficiently because oxygenation is suppressed. There is thus a spatial separation of initial <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> fixation and the Calvin-Benson cycle. This efficiency is not without cost, however, as additional ATP is required to recycle PEP. For this reason, C3 plants may be more efficient in cold climates, where photorespiration is insignificant; under conditions where there is less available light, the higher ATP requirement would become a penalty.</p>
        <p>The C4 pathway is effective at fixing <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> under drought conditions or under conditions where <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> is limited. C4 plants do not need to open their stomata as wide as C3 plants, because their primary carboxylating enzyme is saturated at much lower <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> concentrations. As a result, they lose less water during photosynthesis, and they are better able to cope in regions with arid climates. As humans continue to burn fossil fuels and thus increase the <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> concentration in the atmosphere, the relative advantage C4 plants enjoy in Earth&apos;s warm regions at present will diminish.</p>
        <p>There are also plants with enzymatic and leaf anatomical characteristics intermediate between C3 and C4 plants, called C3-C4 intermediate species. Those plants are thought to be in the pathway of evolution to full C4 photosynthetic status.</p>
        <p>Succulent plants of the desert regions (e.g., cacti) also initially fix <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> into oxaloacetate. This occurs only at night when conditions are cooler, however. Normally, the stomata in leaves or stems, through which plants lose water and acquire carbon dioxide, are open in the day and closed at night; however, the stomates of succulent plants that use the C4 pathway do the opposite and hence prevent loss of water during the hot days. The resultant oxaloacetate is converted into malate, stored in the vacuole as malic acid, and released during the day when the stomates are closed. Malate is decarboxylated, and the <var>CO<sub>2</sub></var> that is released is fixed by Rubisco in the usual Calvin-Benson cycle. Both the C4 and C3 processes take place in the same cell. This process is called crassulacean acid metabolism (hence CAM plants), after a family of succulent plants (Crassulaceae).</p>
