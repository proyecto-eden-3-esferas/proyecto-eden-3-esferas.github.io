Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (\"ergocalciferol\" or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin D3 (\"cholecalciferol\"). Both are also naturally occurring forms that are produced in the presence of the sun’s ultraviolet-B (UVB) rays, but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including humans. Vitamin D production in the skin is the primary natural source of vitamin D, but many people have insufficient levels because they live in places where sunlight is limited in winter, or because they have limited sun exposure. Also, people with darker skin tend to have lower blood levels of vitamin D because the pigment (melanin) acts like a shade, reducing production of vitamin D."]
