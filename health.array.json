      "All children up to three years old should use a toothpaste with a fluoride level of at least 1000ppm (parts per million). After three years old they should use a toothpaste that contains 1350ppm to 1500ppm.",
      "Parents should supervise their children's brushing, and use only a pea-sized smear of fluoride toothpaste until they are about 7 years old.",
      "Spit out after brushing and do not rinse with water, so that the fluoride stays on your teeth longer."
