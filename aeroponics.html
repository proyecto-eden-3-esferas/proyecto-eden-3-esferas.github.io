      <h1>Aeroponics</h1>
      <p><dfn>Aeroponics</dfn> is a way of growing plants without soil, replacing it with a mist of nutrients and water that is sprayed directly onto the roots. This allows farmers to produce salad crops in climate-controlled containers, which can be situated anywhere there is access to water, electricity, and internet.</p>
      <p>Traditional aeroponic farms use nozzles to fire the nutrient solution at the roots under high pressure, but this can be unreliable because of issues with clogging and breaking, according to India Langley of LettUs Grow.</p>
      <p><q>We use ultrasonic technology – sounds above 20,000Hz – which shakes a very small layer of water and fertiliser to form a mist,</q> she says. <q>This travels to the plant root but allows them to have enough oxygen. All the water that is circulating is recaptured, and less water is used because the roots are not submerged.</q></p>
      <p>LettUs Grow&apos;s technology is most commonly used to produce salads, herbs, and microgreens, to start off young trees, and to propagate crops such as coffee and bananas for research trials. The controlled climate allows plants to grow independently of day length and weather patterns.</p>
      <p><q>By growing salads all year you can reduce waste by not flying plants around the world,</q> says India. <q>Growing food more locally reduces food miles, helps food security and gives people access to food all year round. In our system there is no risk of fertiliser run-off and there is no need to use pesticides; everything is contained.</q></p>
      <p>Aeroponic technology has been around since the 1920s, and has been key to NASA&apos;s plans for space exploration. Its aim is to provide fresh food for astronauts on long-term missions, but it also hopes to benefit from the other life-giving attribute of plants: their ability to produce oxygen. Growing plants in space is an extreme version of coping with resource loss and shows what can be achieved without soil and with limited inputs. If plants can be grown successfully without soil or gravity, and with only small amounts of water, it gives hope that Earth-bound growers can rise to the challenge of land degradation and climate change.</p>
      <p>While there&apos;s no commercial value to using aeroponics to grow cereal, owing to the scale required to produce enough useable crops, India sees the technology as being part of the bigger picture for food production.</p>
      <p><q>With agriculture, people often want to pitch one solution – but it has to be a patchwork of ideas,</q> she says. <q>We can grow things that work well inside, and grow things that work well outside. This will free up space to farm more regeneratively.</q></p>
