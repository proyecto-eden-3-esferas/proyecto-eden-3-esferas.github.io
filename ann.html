      <p>Neural nets process information by passing it through a hierarchy of interconnected layers, somewhat akin to the brain&apos;s biological circuitry. The first layer of digital <q>neurons</q>—called <dfn>nodes</dfn>—receives raw inputs (such as pixels in a photograph of a cat), mixes and scores these inputs according to simple mathematical rules, and then passes the outputs to the next layer of nodes. <strong>Deep</strong> nets contain anywhere from three to hundreds of layers, the last of which distills all of this neural activity into a singular prediction: This is a picture of a cat, for example.</p>
      <p>If that prediction is wrong, a neural net will then tweak the links between nodes, steering the system closer to the right result. Actually, the learning process tunes the <dfn>weights</dfn> or numerical coefficients on each artificial neuron. By adjusting the weights to satisfy millions of examples, the neural net creates a structured set of relationships—a <dfn>model</dfn>—that can classify new images or generally perform actions under conditions it has never encountered before.</p>
      <p>That process, known as <dfn>deep learning</dfn>, allows neural nets to create AI models that are too complicated or too tedious to code by hand. These models can be mind-bogglingly complex, with the largest nearing one trillion parameters (weights). You don&apos;t need to tell the system what to look for. You just present it with a few million pictures of cats and it works out what a cat looks like.</p>
      <p>Curiously, some of the rules that get encoded in the model no human can properly understand. They are <a href="digital_subconscious.html">opaque</a>...</p>
