      <h1>Metaprogramming: Writing Programs that Write Programs</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Programs typically read input data, operate on that data and give some output data. <dfn>Metaprograms</dfn> read another program, manipulate that program and return a modified program. Sometimes a metaprogram can change its own behaviour by updating itself. The act of writing metaprograms is called metaprogramming. The language used to write metaprograms is called <dfn>metalanguage</dfn>.</p>
        <p>In general, where code itself needs to change with the data, metaprogramming can be an effective approach. Metaprograms treat code as data, and data as code.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>While metaprogramming has been around for decades, it only from the mid-1990s that it received increasing attention. More and more languages are supporting metaprogramming. Principles of metaprogramming have led to higher levels of abstractions such as meta-modeling, metadesign, metaengineering and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE).</p>
        <h2>What&apos;s the formal definition of metaprogramming?</h2>
        <p>One definition sees metaprogramming as introducing a higher level of abstraction: <q>the technique of specifying generic software source templates from which classes of software components, or parts thereof, can be automatically instantiated to produce new software components.</q>
        <p id="metalanguage">We could define metalanguage thus: <q>any language or symbolic system used to discuss, describe, or analyze another language or symbolic system is a metalanguage.</q> This leads to the definition of metaprogramming: <q>creating application programs by writing programs that produce programs.</q></p>
        <p>Another definition that emphasizes program generation: <q>metaprograms manipulate object-programs</q> where metaprograms <q>may construct object-programs, combine object-program fragments into larger object-programs, observe the structure and other properties of object-programs.</q> A simpler definition is, <q>Metaprogramming is writing programs that themselves write code.</q></p>
