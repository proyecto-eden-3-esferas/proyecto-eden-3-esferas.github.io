      <h1>Amaranth</h1>

      <p>Amaranth is a group of more than 60 different species of grains that have been cultivated for about 8,000 years.</p>
      <p>These grains were once considered a staple food in the Inca, Maya and Aztec civilizations.</p>
      <p>When the Spanish colonized the Americas, they banned crops like amaranth. They were considered part of Aztec religious ceremonies, which unfortunately included human sacrifice. In 1521, Hernán Cortés ordered the burning of all amaranth fields in the Valley of Mexico, a command that would be repeated by conquistadors throughout Latin America. For many years following, amaranth was a lost seed for generations until it finally made a comeback.</p>
      <p>Amaranth is classified as a pseudocereal-- similar to quinoa, in the family <i lang="la">Amaranthaceae</i>-- meaning that it&apos;s not technically a cereal grain like wheat or oats, but it shares a comparable set of nutrients and is used in similar ways. Its earthy, nutty flavor works well in a variety of dishes.</p>
      <p>It is rich in fiber and protein, as well as many important micronutrients.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Grain amaranths are predominately self-pollinated diploids, though outcrossing rates may range from 3.5% to 34% (Brenner et al., 2000). Most are monecious (male and female flowers on the same plant). The haploid chromosome number (n) for most amaranths is 16 or 17.</p>

      <section id="description">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Amaranth is made up of annual or short-lived perennial, herbaceous plants or shrubs collectively known as amaranths. Some names include <q>prostrate pigweed</q> and <q>love lies bleeding</q>. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and even ornamental plants.</p>
        <p>Catkin-like cymes of densely-packed flowers grow in summer or fall. Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and stem color with a range of striking pigments from the spectrum of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 1 to 2.5 metres (3 to 8 feet) tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem that is hollow with grooves and bracteoles when mature. There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which are dioecious and native to North America, and the remaining 65 are monoecious species that are endemic to every continent (except Antarctica) from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus <i lang="la">Celosia</i>. Amaranth grain is collected from the genus.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>An evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the <a target="_blank" href="photosynthesis.html#c4">C4 carbon fixation pathway</a>, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency. This probably occurred in the Miocene.</p>

      <section id="storage">
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>The main challenge with storing amaranth is preventing rancidity, so always store it in an airtight container in a cool place, away from bright light. Whole uncooked amaranth can be kept in the pantry for up to four months and for twice that long in the freezer. Amaranth ﬂour will stay fresh in the pantry for 2 to 3 months and in the freezer for up to 6 months.</p>

        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <section id="nutrition">
          <h3>Nutrition</h3>
          <p>Uncooked amaranth grain by weight is 12% water, 65% carbohydrates (including 7% dietary fiber), 14% protein, and 7% fat (table). A 100-gram (3+1⁄2-ounce) reference serving of uncooked amaranth grain provides 1,550 kilojoules (371 kilocalories) of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, folate, and several dietary minerals (table). Uncooked amaranth is particularly rich in manganese (159% DV), phosphorus (80% DV), magnesium (70% DV), iron (59% DV), and selenium (34% DV). Amaranth has a high oxalate content. Cooking leads to an apparent substantial decrease in nutritional value, though this is mainly due to an increase in water content to 75% by weight.</p>
          <p>Cooked amaranth leaves are a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and manganese, with moderate levels of folate, iron, magnesium, and potassium.</p>
          <p>Amaranth does not contain gluten.</p>

        <section id="amaranth-vs-quinoa">
          <h3> Amaranth vs. Quinoa</h3>
          <p>Because these seeds are from the same family, they share several qualities. Although amaranth and quinoa are referred to as ancient grains, they are both seeds; the two pseudocereals are also naturally gluten-free. Compared to other grains, amaranth and quinoa have short cooking times, although it does take slightly longer for amaranth to reach the desired doneness.</p>
          <p>A visual difference is size: amaranth is a much smaller grain than quinoa. Another obvious differentiation is found in the aroma and flavor. Amaranth is much more distinctive compared to quinoa, with a grassy smell and nutty, strong herbal taste that can be overwhelming for some. While quinoa&apos;s mildness allows it to take on the flavors of the other ingredients in the dish, amaranth takes center stage.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="health">
          <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
          <p>Amaranth has many micronutrients and anti-inflammatory properties. It may help lower cholesterol, aid weight loss, and is gluten-free. It&apos;s easy to make and great in any dish.</p>
          <p>Amaranth grain contains phytochemicals that are not defined as nutrients and may be antinutrient factors, such as polyphenols, saponins, tannins, and oxalates. These compounds are reduced in content and antinutrient effect by cooking.</p>

      <section id="weed">
        <h2>Amaranth as a Weed</h2>
        <p>Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production, and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in tillage, reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often. The following 9 species of Amaranthus are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S. and Canada: A. albus, A. blitoides, A. hybridus, A. palmeri, A. powellii, A. retroflexus, A. spinosus, A. tuberculatus, and A. viridis.</p>
        <p>A new herbicide-resistant strain of A. palmeri has appeared; it is glyphosate-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in soybean yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments. Palmer amaranth is among the "top five most troublesome weeds" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to dinitroaniline herbicides and acetolactate synthase inhibitors. This makes the proper identification of Amaranthus species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.</p>

      <section id="how-to-grow">
        <h2>How to Grow Amaranth</h2>
        <p>Although the full potential of grain amaranth in the food supply has not yet been achieved, its production is increasing due to its nutritious gluten-free grain and resilience to abiotic stresses.</p>
        <p>Amaranth has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A small amount of seed plants a large area (seeding rate 1 kg/ha).</li>
          <li>Yields are high compared to the seeding rate: 1,000 kg or more per hectare.</li>
          <li>It is easily harvested and easily processed, post harvest, as there are no hulls to remove.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr/>
        <p>Three species of amaranth have been domesticated for use as a grain crop: <i lang="la">Amaranthus cruentus</i> in Central America, <i lang="la">A. hypochondriacus</i> in Mexico, and <i lang="la">A. caudatus</i> in the Andean region of South America (Santra et al., 2024).</p>
        <p>Genomic analysis confirms that <i lang="la">A. hybridus</i> is the progenitor of all three species (Clouse et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Although similar for culinary applications, the three species have different adaptations. <i lang="la">A. cruentus</i> is relatively daylength neutral and is the most widely adapted across different latitudes and soil types (Santra et al., 2024). The other two species are daylength sensitive and flower during short days; they are best adapted to higher elevations in lower latitudes (Santra et al., 2024).</p>
        <p>Domesticated amaranths have white seeds, whereas their wild relatives are dark-seeded.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Amaranth is a versatile and resilient crop that is tolerant to a wide range of weather conditions (Aderibigbe et al., 2022). Amaranth requires less water and fertilizer than conventional cereals like corn, wheat, and rice, and is therefore considered an energy-conserving crop (Santra et al., 2024). Having the C4 photosynthetic pathway, amaranths have a fast growth rate and are well adapted to hot, dry conditions. In addition to being grown for grain, amaranths are used for forage, as a leafy vegetable, and as an ornamental plant, due to the richly pigmented leaves and inflorescences of some variants (Brenner et al., 2000).</p>
