      <h1>Borage (<i lang="la">Borago officinalis</i>)</h1>
      <p><dfn>Borage</dfn>, also known as bugloss and starflower (<i lang="la">Borago officinalis</i>) is an easily grown hardy annual flowering herb that comes from Mediterranean countries. Pretty star-shaped pure blue flowers are borne from early summer though to autumn, on spreading bushy plants 60cm high. Bees love borage and the blooms are some of their favourite flowers.</p>
      <p>Borage is an edible herb, with vivid blue flowers and both the flavor and scent of cucumbers. The attractive blooms are a popular garnish to summer drinks, particularly Pimms. The young leaves have a cool cucumber flavour and are ideal to add to salads and salad dressings.</p>

      <section id="grow">
        <h2>How to Grow Borage</h2>
        <p>Borage thrives in a sunny spot and needs a well-drained soil. Because the flowers are so attractive to bees, it&apos;s a useful plant to grow alongside fruit and vegetables to entice more insects to <a target="_blank" href="pollination.html">pollinate</a> crops.</p>
        <p>Borage is often one of the latest annuals to bloom, right up until the first frosts.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>To grow borage, sow seeds directly in a sunny spot after the last frost, as the plant has a deep <a target="_blank" href="taproot.html">taproot</a> that dislikes transplanting. Plant seeds about 0.5 to 1 inch deep, and thin seedlings to about 15 inches (38cm) apart to allow for airflow. Water consistently until established and consider adding a bit of fertilizer to encourage flowering.</p>
          <p>Borage tolerates various soils, including poor soil, but prefers well-drained soil. If your soil is heavy, you can amend it with gravel or plant in a raised bed.</p>

          <h3>Companion Planting</h3>
          <p>Borage is considered a good companion plant for beans, cabbage, cucumbers, peas, peppers, basil, squash, tomatoes and strawberries. It’s even supposed to deter tomato hornworms and improve the flavor of tomatoes growing nearby.</p>
          <p>Do not plant borage near black walnut, potatoes or fennel.</p>

          <h2>Care and maintenance</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Watering</strong> Water regularly to keep the soil consistently moist, especially during dry periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunlight</strong> Plant in a spot with at least half a day of sun. Borage can benefit from some afternoon shade in very hot climates.</li>
            <li><strong>Fertilizing</strong> Borage doesn&apos;t need much fertilizer, especially in good soil. If you do fertilize, use a liquid fertilizer to encourage better foliage and flower production.</li>
            <li><strong>Pests</strong> Borage is relatively pest-resistant. <strong>Powdery mildew</strong> can occur, so ensure good airflow. Watch for aphids, which can be treated with horticultural soap.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="harvesting">
          <h2>Harvesting</h2>
          <p>Borage will reach maturity in about eight weeks, when you can harvest the leaves and flowers as needed. The plants will start to decline if they are not deadheaded and are left to go to seed. Staggering your planting times will give you a longer bloom period, along with a longer harvest time.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>When to harvest</strong> Harvest borage when the flowers open, typically about 12 weeks after planting.</li>
            <li><strong>How to harvest</strong> You can harvest the leaves and flowers. Note that the leaves are fuzzy and can be spiky.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-seeding</strong> Borage will self-seed readily. If you don&apos;t want new plants to sprout next year, deadhead the spent flowers before the seeds develop.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Borage vs. Comfrey</h2>
          <p>Borage and comfrey are both flowering plants from the Boraginaceae family. They look similar to one another when they’re not in bloom.</p>
          <p>However, their flowers can be used as a distinguishing feature. Borage flowers are typically blue, while comfrey flowers are pink, purple, and white. In addition, comfrey generally grows in clumps, while borage can be more sprawling.</p>
