      <h1>Finnish Values</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Some Finnish values are: common sense, education, honesty, and equality. Finland is a country that celebrates summers of seemingly endless sun and finds light in the near total darkness of winter!</p>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <h2>Finnish values</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Equality. According to the Finnish legislation, women and men are equal. ...</li>
          <li>Trust. It is common for Finns to trust other people and the authorities. ...</li>
          <li>Individualism. Finnish culture places more value on individualism than many other cultures. ...</li>
          <li>Own space. ...</li>
          <li>Honesty and punctuality. ...</li>
          <li>Modesty. ...</li>
          <li>Nature.</li>
        </ul>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>Finland as a country has no official motto. Sometimes we use three words beginning with S: <q>Sisu, Sauna and Sibelius</q>. Sisu is hard to translate, it is something like courage and perseverance, sauna is the Finnish bath and Sibelius is the famous Finnish composer. But this saying is informal!</blockquote>

      <h2>What is Finland&apos;s national animal?</h2>
      <p>The brown bear is Finland&apos;s national animal. For ancient Finns the bear was a feared yet revered and respected animal. The importance of the bear in the minds of ancient Finns is demonstrated by the fact that there are over 200 different names for the bear in our language.</p>

        <h2>30+ Famous Finnish Sayings that Will Inspire You</h2>
        <p>The Finnish language is full of sayings and wisdom. I feel that Finnish proverbs are the backbone of the Finnish culture because they</p>
        <ul>
          <li>offer a way of saying your thoughts without being too pushy. Finns hate to be pushy!</li>
          <li>help you understand others</li>
          <li>help you do the right thing in surprising or unpleasant situations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sayings and idioms are passed from one generation to the next by oral tradition and I hope this tradition will continue also in the future.</p>
        <p>There seem to be hundreds of these nuggets of Finnish wisdom because almost every time I have a deeper conversation with an older Finn, I notice a proverb that I haven&apos;t heard before.</p>
        <p>As I&apos;m only a humble admirer of the ancient Finnish words and sentence structures, I have used some artistic liberty in the translations of these Finnish sayings into English.</p>
        <p>My goal has been to honor the saying with my translation, not to hurt it. I&apos;m more than happy to welcome any improvements or ideas to make the translations better. After all, language is always a collective effort.</p>

          <dt>1 The morning is wiser than the evening.</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Finnish: <i lang="su">Aamu on iltaa viisaampi.</i></p>

            <p>If you&apos;re unsure, feeling stressed or discouraged, sleep on it. The following morning shows things from the right perspective.</p>

            <p>This saying can be also written in the opposite way. Ilta on aamua viisaampi. = The evening is wiser than the morning.</p>

            <p>This can be interpreted to mean that you get wiser through age or experience. It can also mean that delaying something can be a good decision, especially if you are acting sentimentally.</p>

            <p>If you&apos;re unsure, you should ask for advice. In general, we Finns don&apos;t ask much advice because we want to be self-sufficient and also, because we don&apos;t want to disturb others.</p>

            <p>This saying reminds Finns that it&apos;s okay to ask. In this sense, there are similarities to the old chestnut in English: <q>There&apos;s no harm in asking.</q></p>

            <p>Finnish happiness has been in the news recently as Finland has topped the UN&apos;s World Happiness Report repeatedly. Even we Finns were a little surprised by this, and this Finnish saying may well explain why.</p>

            <p>The saying could act as a warning about creating inequality: if you have something others don&apos;t, there&apos;s no need to boast, and not much good can come out of making it known. The words could also mean <q>who has luck should hide it</q>.</p>

            <p>Finnish: <i lang="su">P√§iv√§ on pulkassa</i></p>

            <p>This saying is an interesting one. In modern Finnish, the word pulkka is more often used for children&apos;s plastic sled as a winter toy.</p>

            <p>Originally, pulkka in this saying refers to a wooden tally stick that farm owners and their workers used to keep track of work. At the end of the day, both parties would place the two sticks next to each other and mark the same spot on each tally stick. That meant the workers had finished work for the day.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, it would be easy to interpret the saying as <q>the day&apos;s work is in the sled</q>, which probably partly explains the expression&apos;s popularity even though tally sticks are long gone.</p>

            <p>The Finnish version of <q>live and learn</q>, this saying suggests you keep learning new things all your life through experience.</p>

The competition winner was Eeva, who completed the 40-meter course in just 15 seconds. Afterward, the ladies headed to the gym.</p>
