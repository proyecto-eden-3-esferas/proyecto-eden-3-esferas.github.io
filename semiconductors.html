      <p><dfn>Semiconductors</dfn> exhibit electrical behavior between insulators and conductors. Semiconductors, particularly silicon, are used to create transistors which are the most common circuit component. Billions of transistors fit into one small integrated circuit (IC) inside smartphones, computers, and cars.</p>

        <h2>Band Theory of Solids</h2>
        <p>Quantum physics describes the states of electrons in an atom according to the four-fold scheme of quantum numbers. The quantum numbers describe the allowable states electrons may assume in an atom. To use the analogy of an amphitheater, quantum numbers describe how many rows and seats are available. Individual electrons may be described by the combination of quantum numbers, like a spectator in an amphitheater assigned to a particular row and seat.</p>
        <p>Like spectators in an amphitheater moving between seats and rows, electrons may change their statuses, given the presence of available spaces for them to fit, and available energy. Since shell level is closely related to the amount of energy that an electron possesses, <q>leaps</q> between shell (and even subshell) levels requires transfers of energy. If an electron is to move into a higher-order shell, it requires that additional energy be given to the electron from an external source. Using the amphitheater analogy, it takes an increase in energy for a person to move into a higher row of seats because that person must climb to a greater height against the force of gravity. Conversely, an electron <q>leaping</q> into a lower shell gives up some of its energy, like a person jumping down into a lower row of seats, the expended energy manifesting as heat and sound.</p>
        <p>Not all <q>leaps</q> are equal. Leaps between different shells require a substantial exchange of energy, but leaps between subshells or between orbitals require lesser exchanges.</p>
        <p>When atoms combine to form substances, the outermost shells, subshells, and orbitals merge, providing a greater number of available energy levels for electrons to assume. When large numbers of atoms are close to each other, these available energy levels form a nearly continuous band wherein electrons may move<!-- as illustrated in Figure below-->.</p>
        <p>It is the width of these bands and their proximity to existing electrons that determines how mobile those electrons will be when exposed to an electric field. In metallic substances, empty bands overlap with bands containing electrons, meaning that electrons of a single atom may move to what would normally be a higher-level state with little or no additional energy imparted. Thus, the outer electrons are said to be <q>free,</q> and ready to move at the beckoning of an electric field.</p>
        <p>Band overlap will not occur in all substances, no matter how many atoms are close to each other. In some substances, a substantial gap remains between the highest band containing electrons (the so-called <dfn>valence band</dfn>) and the next band, which is empty (the so-called <dfn>conduction band</dfn>).<!-- See Figure below.--> As a result, valence electrons are <q>bound</q> to their constituent atoms and cannot become mobile within the substance without a significant amount of imparted energy. These substances are <strong>electrical insulators</strong>.</p>
        <aside>The electron band configurations produced by compounds of different elements defy easy association with the electron configurations of its constituent elements.</aside>

          <h3>Bands in Semiconductors</h3>
          <p>Materials that fall within the category of <dfn>semiconductors</dfn> have a narrow gap between the valence and conduction bands. Thus, the amount of energy required to motivate a valence electron into the conduction band where it becomes mobile is quite modest.</p>
          <p>At low temperatures, little thermal energy is available to push valence electrons across this gap, and the semiconducting material acts more as an insulator. At higher temperatures, though, the ambient thermal energy becomes enough to force electrons across the gap, and the material will increase the conduction of electricity. It is difficult to predict the conductive properties of a substance by examining the electron configurations of its constituent atoms. Although the best metallic conductors of electricity (silver, copper, and gold) all have outer s subshells with a single electron, the relationship between conductivity and valence electron count is not necessarily consistent.</p>

        <h2>Electrons and <q>Holes</q></h2>
        <p>Pure semiconductors are relatively good insulators as compared with metals, though not nearly as good as a true insulator like glass. To be useful in semiconductor applications, the intrinsic semiconductor (pure undoped semiconductor) must have no more than one impurity atom in 10 billion semiconductor atoms. This is analogous to a grain of salt impurity in a railroad boxcar of sugar. Impure, or dirty semiconductors are considerably more conductive, though not as good as metals. Why might this be? To answer that question, we must look at the electron structure<!-- of such materials in Figure below-->.</p>
        <section id="electron-structure">
          <h3>Electron Structure</h3>
          <p>The figure below (a) shows four electrons in the valence shell of a semiconductor forming covalent bonds to four other atoms. <!--This is a flattened, easier to draw, version of Figure above. -->All electrons of an atom are tied up in four covalent bonds, pairs of shared electrons. Electrons are not free to move about the crystal lattice. Thus, intrinsic, pure, semiconductors are relatively good insulators as compared to metals.</p>
          <p>Thermal energy may occasionally free an electron from the crystal lattice as in Figure above (b). This electron is free for conduction about the crystal lattice. When the electron was freed, it left an empty spot with a positive charge in the crystal lattice known as a hole. This hole is not fixed to the lattice; but, is free to move about. The free electron and hole both contribute to conduction about the crystal lattice. That is, the electron is free until it falls into a hole. This is called <dfn>recombination</dfn>. If an external electric field is applied to the semiconductor, the electrons and holes will conduct in opposite directions. Increasing temperature will increase the number of electrons and holes, decreasing the resistance. This is opposite of metals, where resistance increases with temperature by increasing the collisions of electrons with the crystal lattice. The number of electrons and holes in an intrinsic semiconductor are equal. However, both carriers do not necessarily move with the same velocity with the application of an external field. Another way of stating this is that <dfn>mobility</dfn> is not the same for electrons and holes.</p>

        <section id="impurities">
          <h3>Semiconductor Impurities</h3>
          <p>Pure semiconductors, by themselves, are not particularly useful. Nevertheless, semiconductors must be refined to a high level of purity as a starting point prior to the addition of specific impurities.</p>
          <p>Semiconductor material pure to 1 part in 10 billion, may have specific impurities added at approximately 1 part per 10 million to increase the number of carriers. The addition of the desired impurity to a semiconductor is known as <dfn>doping</dfn>. Doping increases the conductivity of a semiconductor so that it is more comparable to metal than an insulator.</p>
          <p>It is possible to increase the number of negative charge carriers within the semiconductor crystal lattice by doping with an electron donor like Phosphorus. Electron donors, also known as <dfn>N-type</dfn> dopants include elements from group VA of the periodic table: nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony. Nitrogen and phosphorus are N-type dopants for diamond. Phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are used with silicon.</p>
          <p>The crystal lattice in Figure below (b) contains atoms having four electrons in the outer shell, forming four covalent bonds to adjacent atoms. This is the anticipated crystal lattice. The addition of a phosphorus atom with five electrons in the outer shell introduces an extra electron into the lattice as compared with the silicon atom. The pentavalent impurity forms four covalent bonds to four silicon atoms with four of the five electrons, fitting into the lattice with one electron left over. Note that this spare electron is not strongly bonded to the lattice as the electrons of normal Si atoms are. It is free to move about the crystal lattice, not being bound to the Phosphorus lattice site. Since we have doped at one part phosphorus in 10 million silicon atoms, few free electrons were created compared with the numerous silicon atoms. However, many electrons were created compared with the fewer electron-hole pairs in intrinsic silicon. Application of an external electric field produces strong conduction in the doped semiconductor in the conduction band (above the valence band). A heavier doping level produces stronger conduction. Thus, a poorly conducting intrinsic semiconductor has been converted into a good electrical conductor.</p>
          <p>It is also possible to introduce an impurity lacking an electron as compared with silicon, having three electrons in the valence shell as compared with four for silicon. In Figure above (c), this leaves an empty spot known as a <dfn>hole</dfn>, a positive charge carrier. The boron atom tries to bond to four silicon atoms, but only has three electrons in the valence band. In attempting to form four covalent bonds the three electrons move around trying to form four bonds. This makes the hole appear to move. Furthermore, the trivalent atom may borrow an electron from an adjacent (or more distant) silicon atom to form four covalent bonds. However, this leaves the silicon atom deficient by one electron. In other words, the hole has moved to an adjacent (or more distant) silicon atom. Holes reside in the valence band, a level below the conduction band. Doping with an electron acceptor, an atom which may accept an electron, creates a deficiency of electrons, the same as an excess of holes. Since holes are positive charge carriers, an electron acceptor dopant is also known as a <dfn>P-type</dfn> dopant. The P-type dopant leaves the semiconductor with an excess of holes, positive charge carriers. The P-type elements from group IIIA of the periodic table include boron, aluminum, gallium, and indium. Boron is used as a P-type dopant for silicon and diamond semiconductors, while indium is used with germanium.</p>
          <hr/>
          <p>Electron flow in an N-type semiconductor is similar to electrons moving in a metallic wire. The N-type dopant atoms will yield electrons available for conduction. These electrons due to the dopant are known as <dfn>majority carriers</dfn>, for they are in the majority as compared to the very few thermal holes.</p>
          <p>Current flow in a P-type semiconductor is a little more difficult to explain. The P-type dopant, an electron acceptor, yields localized regions of positive charge known as <dfn>holes</dfn>. The majority carrier in a P-type semiconductor is the hole. While holes form at the trivalent dopant atom sites, they may move about the semiconductor sample.</p>

          <h3>Elements used to Produce Semiconductors</h3>
          <p>The oldest group IVA bulk semiconductor material germanium is only used to a limited extent today. Silicon-based semiconductors account for about 90% of commercial production of all semiconductors. Diamond based semiconductors are a research and development activity with considerable potential at this time.</p>
          <p>Compound semiconductors include silicon germanium (thin layers on Si wafers), silicon carbide and III-V compounds such as gallium arsenide. III-VI compound semiconductors include AlN, GaN, InN, AlP, AlAs, AlSb, GaP, GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, AlxGa1-xAs, and InxGa1-xAs. Columns II and VI of the periodic table<!--, not shown in the figure,--> also form compound semiconductors.</p>

        <h2>The P-N Junction</h2>
        <!-- https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-2/the-p-n-junction/ -->
        <p>If a block of P-type semiconductor is placed in contact with a block of N-type semiconductor<!-- in Figure below(a)-->, the result is of no value. We have two conductive blocks in contact with each other, showing no unique properties. The problem is they are two separate and distinct crystal bodies. The number of electrons is balanced by the number of protons in both blocks. Thus, neither block has any net charge.</p>
        <p>However, a <em>single</em> semiconductor crystal manufactured with P-type material at one end and N-type material at the other<!-- in Figure below (b)--> has some unique properties. The P-type material has positive majority charge carriers, holes, which are free to move about the crystal lattice. The N-type material has mobile negative majority carriers, electrons. Near the junction, the N-type material electrons diffuse across the junction, combining with holes in P-type material. The region of the P-type material near the junction takes on a net negative charge because of the electrons attracted. Since electrons departed the N-type region, it takes on a localized positive charge. The thin layer of the crystal lattice between these charges has been depleted of majority carriers, thus, is known as the <dfn>depletion region</dfn>. It becomes nonconductive <strong>intrinsic semiconductor</strong> material. In effect, we have nearly an insulator separating the conductive P and N doped regions.</p>
        <p>This separation of charges at the PN junction constitutes a potential barrier. This potential barrier must be overcome by an external voltage source to make the junction conduct. The formation of the junction and potential barrier happens during the manufacturing process. The magnitude of the potential barrier is a function of the materials used in manufacturing. Silicon PN junctions have a higher potential barrier than germanium junctions.</p>
        <section id="p-n-junction-bias">
          <h3>PN Junction Bias</h3>
          <p>In the figure below the battery is arranged so that the negative terminal supplies electrons to the N-type material. These electrons diffuse toward the junction. The positive terminal removes electrons from the P-type semiconductor, creating holes that diffuse toward the junction. If the battery voltage is great enough to overcome the junction potential (0.6V in Si), the N-type electrons and P-holes combine annihilating each other. This frees up space within the lattice for more carriers to flow toward the junction. Thus, currents of N-type and P-type majority carriers flow toward the junction. The recombination at the junction allows battery current to flow through the PN junction diode. Such a junction is said to be <dfn>forward-biased</dfn>.</p>
          <p>If the battery polarity is reversed as in Figure above(b) majority carriers are attracted away from the junction toward the battery terminals. The positive battery terminal attracts N-type majority carriers, electrons, away from the junction. The negative terminal attracts P-type majority carriers, holes, away from the junction. This increases the thickness of the nonconducting depletion region. There is no recombination of majority carriers; thus, no conduction. This arrangement of battery polarity is called <dfn>reverse bias</dfn>.</p>

        <section id="diodes">
          <h3>Diodes</h3>
          <p><!--The diode schematic symbol is illustrated in Figure below(b) corresponding to the doped semiconductor bar at (a). -->The <dfn>diode</dfn> is a unidirectional device. Current only flows in one direction, Alongside the arrow, corresponding to forward bias. The cathode, bar, of the diode symbol, corresponds to N-type semiconductor. The anode, arrow, corresponds to the P-type semiconductor.<!-- To remember this relationship, Not-pointing (bar) on the symbol corresponds to N-type semiconductor. Pointing (arrow) corresponds to P-type.--></p>
          <p>If a diode is forward biased<!-- as in Figure above(a)-->, the current will increase slightly as the voltage is increased from 0 V. In the case of a silicon diode a measurable current flows when the voltage approaches 0.6 V<!-- in Figure above(c)-->. As the voltage increases past 0.6 V, current increases considerably after the knee. Increasing the voltage well beyond 0.7 V may result in high enough current to destroy the diode. The forward voltage, VF, is a characteristic of the semiconductor: 0.6 to 0.7 V for silicon, 0.2 V for germanium, a few volts for Light Emitting Diodes (LED). The forward current ranges from a few mA for point contact diodes to 100 mA for small signal diodes to tens or thousands of amperes for power diodes.</p>
          <p>If the diode is reverse biased, only the leakage current of the intrinsic semiconductor flows.<!-- This is plotted to the left of the origin in Figure above(c).--> This current will only be as high as 1 µA for the most extreme conditions for silicon small signal diodes. This current does not increase appreciably with increasing reverse bias until the diode breaks down. At the breakdown, the current increases so greatly that the diode will be destroyed unless a high series resistance limits current. We normally select a diode with a higher reverse voltage rating than any applied voltage to prevent this. Silicon diodes are typically available with reverse break down ratings of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 V and higher. It is possible to fabricate diodes with a lower rating of a few volts for use as voltage standards.</p>
          <p>We previously mentioned that the reverse leakage current of under one µA for silicon diodes was due to the conduction of the intrinsic semiconductor. This is the leakage that can be explained by theory. Thermal energy produces few electron-hole pairs, which conduct leakage current until recombination. In actual practice, this predictable current is only part of the leakage current. Much of the leakage current is due to surface conduction, related to the lack of cleanliness of the semiconductor surface. Both leakage currents increase with increasing temperature, approaching a µA for small silicon diodes.</p>
          <p>For germanium, the leakage current is orders of magnitude higher. Since germanium semiconductors are rarely used today, this is not a problem in practice.</p>
