      <h1>Linked Data</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The goal of Linked Data is to publish structured data in such a way that it can be easily consumed and combined with other Linked Data.</p>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <p>The Big Picture: Building a Web of Data</p>
        <p>Linked Data is not only about exposing data using Web technologies. Nor is it simply an elegant way to solve interoperability issues. Linked data is fundamentally about building a <strong>Web of Data</strong>.</p>
        <p>Imagine hundreds of different <a href="dataset.html">data sets</a> published on the Web according to the Linked Data principles: thousands and thousands different identifiers you can rely to grab data about books, movies, actors, cities, or anything your can imagine. In few words, such datasets form a giant Web-scale database you could potentially embed in your applications and reference whenever you needed.</p>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <p>A pragmatic and informal set of metrics have been introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web: the <cite>5 Stars of Linked Open Data. Basically</cite>, it&apos;s a set of incremental characteristics that published data sets should have. The more of these features a data set has, the higher the quality of its data.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One star:</strong> make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format)</li>
          <li><strong>Two stars:</strong> make it available as structured data (e.g. Excel instead of image scan of a table)</li>
          <li><strong>Three stars:</strong> non-proprietary format (e.g. CSV instead of Excel)</li>
          <li><strong>Four starts:</strong> use URLs to identify things, so that people can point at your stuff</li>
          <li><strong>Five stars:</strong> link your data to other people&apos;s data to provide context</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data published in accordance to the Linked Data principles is clearly 5 Star quality. 5 Star datasets are intrinsically more valuable because the data within has been made accessible through <a href="TheWeb.html">the Web</a> (so you can get at it), has been exposed with open <a href="SoftwareStandard.html">standards</a> (so its easily consumable), and has been linked to other data (so it&apos;s verifiable and more easily integrated). The combination makes application development absolutely more cost-efficient and less time-consuming compared to using less quality datasets.</p>
