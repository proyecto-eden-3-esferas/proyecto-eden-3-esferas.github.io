      <h1>Knowledge Representation</h1>
      <p>Knowledge representation (KR) in AI refers to encoding information about the world into formats that AI systems can utilize to solve complex tasks. This process enables machines to reason, learn, and make decisions by structuring data in a way that mirrors human understanding.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In order for an <a target="_blank" href="ai.html">AI</a> (Artificial Intelligence) agent to understand information correctly, the information must be presented to it clearly and neatly. There are mainly four ways of doing this. <dfn>Logical representation</dfn> represents information using exact words of a natural language (or <a target="_blank" href="symbols.html">symbols</a> to represent them). <dfn>Semantic representation</dfn> ensures that the individual meanings within the information are connected in a formal, logical way (<i>read about the </i> <a href="SemanticWeb.html" target="_blank">Semantic Web</a>). <dfn>Frame representation</dfn> involves presenting the information in a tabular format, with facts allocated to individual <q>slots</q>, as in a <a href="database.html" target="_blank">database</a>. Finally, <dfn>production rules</dfn> are the instructions that state what conclusions an AI can deduce from the information it is supplied with. It uses connectors like IF and THEN so that statements may be deduced from it.</p>

        <h2>Kinds of Knowledge: What, When, Why, and How?</h2>
        <p>AI systems use up to five kinds of knowledge in their interactions with the world, but only two are common to  all AIs. <dfn>Declarative knowledge</dfn> is the most basic form and describes statements of fact, such as <q>cats are mammals,</q> whereas <dfn>procedural knowledge</dfn> instructs AIs how  to complete specific tasks. In some AIs, meta-, heuristic, and structural knowledge provide further information that enables them to solve problems.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Declarative:</strong> Basic facts that an AI needs in order to function.</li>
          <li><strong>Procedural:</strong> Rules and instructions that an AI needs in order to perform a task.</li>
          <li><strong>MetaInformation:</strong> describes the  knowledge the  AI is using (knowledge about knowledge)</li>
          <li><strong>Structural:</strong> Knowledge that explains how different components relate to one another.</li>
          <li><strong>Heuristic:</strong> Useful shortcuts, based on human experience, that help an AI agent to function.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of Knowledge Representation in AI</h2>
        <p>Knowledge representation is applied across various domains in AI, enabling systems to perform tasks that require human-like understanding and reasoning. Some notable applications include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="expert-systems.html">Expert Systems:</a></strong> These systems use knowledge representation to provide advice or make decisions in specific domains, such as medical diagnosis or financial planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Knowledge representation is used to understand and generate human language, enabling applications like chatbots, translation systems, and sentiment analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> Robots use knowledge representation to navigate, interact with environments, and perform tasks autonomously.</li>
          <li><strong><a target="_blank" href="SemanticWeb.html">Semantic Web:</a></strong> The Semantic Web relies on <a target="_blank" href="Ontologies.html">ontologies</a> and other knowledge representation techniques to enable machines to understand and process web content meaningfully.</li>
          <li><strong>Cognitive Computing:</strong> Systems like IBM&apos;s <cite>Watson</cite> use knowledge representation to process vast amounts of information, reason about it, and provide insights in fields like healthcare and research.</li>
        </ul>
