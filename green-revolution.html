      <h1>Green Revolution</h1>
      <p>The introduction into developing countries of new strains of wheat and rice was a major aspect of what became known as the <dfn>Green Revolution</dfn>. Given adequate water and ample amounts of the required chemical fertilizers and pesticides, these varieties have resulted in significantly higher yields. Poorer farmers, however, often have not been able to provide the required growing conditions and therefore have obtained even lower yields with <q>improved</q> grains than they had gotten with the older strains that were better adapted to local conditions and that had some resistance to pests and diseases. Where chemicals are used, concern has been voiced about their cost—since they generally must be imported—and about their potentially harmful effects on the environment.</p>
