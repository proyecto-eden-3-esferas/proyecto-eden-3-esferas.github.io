      <h1>Green Revolution</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>green revolution</dfn>, great increase in the production of food grains, especially wheat and rice, driven by the introduction of high-yield crop varieties to developing countries during the mid-20th century. Its early dramatic successes were in Mexico and India before gradually spreading to other countries. The new varieties revolutionized agriculture and helped reduce poverty and hunger in many developing countries. However, the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides raised concerns about affordability and environmental damage. Norman Borlaug, an American scientist, is credited with propelling the green revolution.</p>

      <p>The introduction into developing countries of new strains of wheat and rice was a major aspect of what became known as the <dfn>Green Revolution</dfn>. Given adequate water and ample amounts of the required chemical fertilizers and pesticides, these varieties have resulted in significantly higher yields. Poorer farmers, however, often have not been able to provide the required growing conditions and therefore have obtained even lower yields with <q>improved</q> grains than they had gotten with the older strains that were better adapted to local conditions and that had some resistance to pests and diseases. Where chemicals are used, concern has been voiced about their cost—since they generally must be imported—and about their potentially harmful effects on the environment.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What began as an experiment in Mexico eventually revolutionized agriculture throughout the world, especially in developing countries such as Brazil, China, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The green revolution industrialized agriculture. Modern farming, characterized by chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation, replaced traditional methods of cultivation. Although groundbreaking, this progress was not without consequences. The excessive reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides led to increased levels of pollution, <a target="_blank" href="soil.html">soil</a> degradation, and biodiversity loss. Large scale <a target="_blank" href="irrigation.html">irrigation</a> projects have resulted in depleted groundwater levels. Poor farmers are often unable to purchase modern agricultural inputs, such as high-yield seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation systems, leaving them with low yields.</p>
