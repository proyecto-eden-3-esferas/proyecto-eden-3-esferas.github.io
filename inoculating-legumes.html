      <h1>Inoculating Legumes Seeds</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Add the inoculant to another medium (eg peat mixed with water and gum arabic) – use 1 part sticking substance (eg gum arabic) to 10 parts water; other sticking materials that can be used include corn syrup, sugar, powdered milk or various commercial stickers</li>
        <li>It is critical to use only fresh inoculant in the appropriate concentration</li>
        <li>Use the appropriate rhizobium for the legume being grown; keep in mind that rhizobia perform better on some legumes (eg alfalfa) when seed is coated with calcium carbonate, while others perform better when left uncoated (eg red clover)</li>
        <li>Check the expiry date – commercially produced, pelleted seed should be sown as soon as possible; at least within four weeks of production, as it does not store well</li>
        <li>Always store inoculant in a cool, dark place</li>
        <li>In dry conditions, inoculant rate may need to be doubled</li>
        <li>If legumes exhibit yellowing of foliage, this may indicate nitrogen deficiency resulting from failure of the inoculant</li>
        <li>Applying some nitrogenous fertiliser when planting a cover crop may actually enhance the nitrogen fixation of the legumes (eg around 30 kg per hectare of starter nitrogen)</li>
        <li>Generally soil pH needs to be over 5.5 for rhizobia to survive</li>
      </ul>
