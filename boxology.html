      <h1>Boxology</h1>
      <p>A <dfn>boxology</dfn> is a representation of an organized structure as a graph of labeled nodes (<dfn>boxes</dfn>) and connections between them (as lines or arrows). The concept is useful because many problems in systems design are reducible to modular <q>black boxes</q> and connections or flow channels between them. The term is somewhat tongue-in-cheek  and refers to the generic nature of diagrams containing labelled nodes and (sometimes directed) paths between them.</p>
      <p>The archetypical example of a boxology is a corporate <q>org chart</q>, which describes lines of control through the corporation. Other boxologies include programming flow charts, system-level circuit diagrams for designing large complex circuits, and even economic models. Feynman diagrams are useful because they reduce the complicated mathematics of quantum mechanics to a simple boxology of particle interactions.</p>
      <p>Depending on application, the boxes are optional; for example, the global carbon cycle is modeled as a boxology, but many figures explaining the model include only labels and directed connections.</p>
