      <h1>Regular Expressions: A Language of Text Patterns</h1>
      <p>Regular expressions are a miniature language used for matching complex text patterns and thus transforming text. They are a powerful tool that only require a small time investment to learn. They are supported by most modern <a href="programming.html">programming</a> languages and by most text editors and text processors.</p>
      <p>A <dfn>regular expression</dfn> pattern is a sequence of characters representing what you want to match in a given string. Any character in the regular expression matches itself except for some special characters.</p>

      <section id="uses">
        <h2>The Uses of Regular Expressions</h2>
        <p>Regular expressions can be used for several string-related operations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Validation:</strong> Check if an input string is well-formed.</p>
            <p>For example: Is the input string a well-formed phone number?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Check what kind of string an input represents.</p>
            <p>For example: Is the input string the name of a JPEG or a PNG file?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Parsing:</strong> Extract information from an input string.</p>
            <p>For example: From a full filename, extract the filename part without the full path and without its extension.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Transformation:</strong> Search sub-strings and replace them with a new formatted sub-string.</p>
            <p>For example: Search all occurrences of "C++14" and replace them with "C++".</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Iteration:</strong> Search all occurrences of a sub-string.</p>
            <p>For example: Extract all phone numbers from an input string.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Tokenization:</strong> Split a string into sub-strings based on a set of delimiters.</p>
            <p>For example: Split a string on whitespace, commas, periods, and so on to extract its individual words.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Regular Expression Components and Terminology</h2>
        <p>Before we can go into more detail on the regular expressions, there is some important terminology to know. The following terms are used throughout the discussion:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><dfn>Pattern</dfn> The actual regular expression is a pattern represented by a string.</li>
          <li><dfn>Match</dfn> Determines whether there is a match between a given regular expression and all of the characters in a given sequence [first,last).</li>
          <li><dfn>Search</dfn> Determines whether there is some sub-string within a given sequence [first,last) that matches a given regular expression.</li>
          <li><dfn>Replace</dfn>: Identifies sub-strings in a given sequence, and replaces them with a corresponding new sub-string computed from another pattern, called a <dfn>substitution pattern</dfn>.</li>
        </ul>

        <section id="chars-in-brackets">
          <h3>Character Classes and Bracket Expressions</h3>
          <p>A <dfn>bracket expression</dfn> is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ]. It matches any single character in that list. If the first character of the list is the caret ^ then it matches any character not in the list; it is unspecified whether it matches an encoding error. For example, the regular expression <code>[0123456789]</code> matches any single digit.</p>
          <p>Within a bracket expression, a <dfn>range expression</dfn> consists of two characters separated by a hyphen. It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set. For example, in the default C locale, <code>[a-d]</code> is equivalent to <code>[abcd]</code>.</p>
          <p>Many locales sort characters in dictionary order, and in these locales <code>[a-d]</code> is typically not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to <code>[aBbCcDd]</code>, for example. To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.</p>
          <p>Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows. Their names are self explanatory, and they are <code>[:alnum:]</code>, <code>[:alpha:]</code>, <code>[:blank:]</code>, <code>[:cntrl:]</code>, <code>[:digit:]</code>, <code>[:graph:]</code>, <code>[:lower:]</code>, <code>[:print:]</code>, <code>[:punct:]</code>, <code>[:space:]</code>, <code>[:upper:]</code>, and <code>[:xdigit:]</code>. For example, <code>[[:alnum:]]</code> means the character class of numbers and letters in the current locale.  In the C  locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is the same as  <code>[0-9A-Za-z]</code>. (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket expression.)   Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions. To include a literal ] place it first in the list. Similarly, to include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first. Finally, to include a literal  - place it last.</p>

        <section id="anchoring">
          <h3>Anchoring</h3>
          <p>The  caret  ^  and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="">
          <h3>The Backslash Character and Special Expressions</h3>
          <p>The symbols \&lt; and \&gt; respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word. The symbol \b matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and \B matches the empty string provided it's not at the edge of a word. The symbol \w is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].</p>

        <section id="repetition">
          <h3>Repetition</h3>
          <p>A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:</p>
          <table border="1">
            <tr> <th><code>?</code></th> <td>The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>*</code></th> <td>The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>+</code></th> <td>The preceding item will be matched one or more times.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>{n}</code></th> <td>The preceding item is matched exactly n times.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>{n,}</code></th> <td>The preceding item is matched n or more times.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>{,m}</code></th> <td>The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.</td> </tr>
            <tr> <th><code>{n,m}</code></th> <td>The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.</td> </tr>
          </table>

          <h3>Greedy versus Lazy Quantifiers</h3>
          <p>The distinction between greedy and lazy quantifiers concerns how much of the input string is consumed during a match. By default, quantifiers are <dfn>greedy</dfn>, meaning they match as many occurrences of the preceding element as possible. For instance, given the pattern <q>a.*b</q> applied to the string <q>aabab</q>, a greedy quantifier may consume more characters than intended, potentially causing the match to extend unexpectedly. <dfn>Lazy</dfn> quantifiers, on the other hand, attempt to match the fewest number of characters necessary to satisfy the pattern, typically indicated by appending a question mark to the quantifier itself. For example, <q>a.*?b</q> modifies the pattern to stop at the first occurrence of <q>b</q>.</p>
          <p>Understanding the difference between greedy and lazy quantifiers is crucial, as it directly impacts the behavior of the regex when multiple potential matches are available.</p>

        <section id="capture-group">
          <h3>Capture Groups</h3>
          <p>A <dfn>capture group</dfn> allows further analyzing the search result in a regular expression. They are defined by a pair of parentheses ( ). The regular expression <code>((a+)(b+)(c+))</code> has four capture groups: ((a+)(b+)(c+)), (a+), (b+) and (c+) The total result is the 0-th capture group.</p>
