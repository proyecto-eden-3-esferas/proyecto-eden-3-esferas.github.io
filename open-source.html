      <h1>Open Source</h1>
      <p>Open source follows these key tenets:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
        <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.</li>
        <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</li>
        <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>open source</dfn>, social movement, begun by computer programmers, that rejects secrecy and centralized control of creative work in favour of decentralization, transparency, and unrestricted (<q>open</q>) sharing of information. Source refers to the human-readable source code of computer <a target="_blank" href="programming.html">programs</a>, as opposed to the compiled computer programming language instructions, or object code, that run on computers but cannot be easily understood or modified by people.</p>
        <p>In <dfn>closed-source</dfn>, or proprietary, software development, only the object code is published; the source code is held secret in order to control customers and markets. Open-source projects reject this practice and publish all their source code on the Internet under licenses that allow free redistribution, which is why some consider open source a kind of freeware. An important feature of open-source development is that the resulting extensive peer review seems to do a better job of minimizing computer bugs and computer security risks than the typical in-house process of quality assurance at closed-source vendors.</p>
        <p>Beyond computer software, the concept of open source has been used to create free online <a target="_blank" href="database.html">databases</a> and by commercial Internet vendors to populate reviews of items for sale, such as books, music, and movies.</p>
