      <h1><i lang="sa">Mandala</i> (Sacrad Diagram)</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>mandala</dfn>, in Hindu Tantrism and Buddhist Vajrayana, a symbolic <a target="_blank" href="diagram.html">diagram</a> used in the performance of sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation. The mandala is basically a representation of the universe, a consecrated area that serves as a receptacle for the gods and as a collection point of universal forces. Man (the microcosm), by mentally <q>entering</q> the mandala and <q>proceeding</q> toward its centre, is by analogy guided through the cosmic processes of disintegration and reintegration.</p>
        <p>Mandalas in China, Japan, and Tibet are basically of two types, representing different aspects of the universe: the <i lang="sa">garbha-dhatu</i> (Sanskrit: <q>womb world</q>; Japanese <i lang="ja">taizō-kai</i>), in which the movement is from the one to the many; and the <i lang="sa">vajra-dhatu</i> (Sanskrit: <q>diamond [or thunderbolt] world</q>; Japanese <i lang="ja">kongō-kai</i>), from the many into one.</p>
        <p>Mandalas may be painted on paper or cloth, drawn on a carefully prepared ground with white and coloured threads or with rice powders (as for Buddhist Tantric ceremonies of initiation), fashioned in bronze, or built in stone, as at Borobudur, in central Java. There the circumambulation of the <dfn>stupa</dfn> (a commemorative monument) is tantamount to the ritual approach to the centre.</p>
        <p>The mandala of a Tibetan <i lang="bo">tanka</i> (cloth scroll painting) characteristically consists of an outer enclosure around one or more concentric circles, which in turn surround a square transversed by lines from the centre to the four corners. In the centre and the middle of each triangle are five circles containing symbols or images of divinities, most commonly the five <q><a target="_blank" href="five-buddha-families.html">self-born</a></q> buddhas (or Five Buddha Families). Of the borders surrounding the mandala, the first is a ring of fire, which both bars entry to the uninitiated and symbolizes the burning of ignorance; next comes a girdle of diamonds, which stands for illumination; then a circle of eight graveyards, symbolizing the eight aspects of individuating cognition; next a girdle of lotus leaves, signifying spiritual rebirth; and, finally, at the centre, the mandala itself, where the images are set.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>Similar ritual drawings have been found in cultures other than Hindu and Buddhist—for example, in the sand paintings of the North American Indians. The Swiss psychologist <a target="_blank" href="jung.html">Carl Jung</a> published studies of mandala-like drawings executed by his patients. In his view, the spontaneous production of a mandala is a step in the individuation process—a central concept in Jung&apos;s psychological theory—and represents an attempt by the conscious self to integrate hitherto unconscious material.</p>
