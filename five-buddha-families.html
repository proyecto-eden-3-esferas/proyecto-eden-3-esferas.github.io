      <h1>The Five Buddha Families</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, the Five Tathāgatas (Skt: पञ्चतथागत, <i lang="sa">pañcatathāgata</i>; (Ch: 五方佛, Wǔfāngfó) or Five Wisdom <i lang="sa">Tathāgatas</i> (Ch: 五智如来, Wǔzhì Rúlái), are the five cardinal male and female Buddhas that are inseparable co-equals, although the male cardinal Buddhas are more often represented. Collectively, the male and female Buddhas are known as the Five Buddha Families (<i lang="sa">pañcabuddhakula</i>). The five are also called the Five Great Buddhas, and the Five <i lang="sa">Jinas</i> (Skt. for "conqueror" or "victor").</p>
        <p>The Five Buddha Families are a common subject of Vajrayana and Tibetan Buddhist mandalas and they feature prominently in various Buddhist Tantras as the intrinsically inseparable father and mother Buddhas. Various sources provide different names for these male and female Buddhas, though the most common names today are: In the east, <i lang="sa">Vairocana</i> and Buddha <i lang="sa">Locana</i>; in the south <i lang="sa">Ratnasambhava</i> and Buddha <i lang="sa">Mamaki</i>; in the west <i lang="sa">Amitābha Panadaravasini</i>; in the north <i lang="sa">Amoghasiddhi</i> and <i lang="sa">Samayatara</i>; and in the center <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i> and <i lang="sa">Dhatvisvari</i>. They are sometimes seen as emanations and representations of the five qualities of the <i lang="sa">Adi-Buddha</i> or "first Buddha", which is associated with the <i lang="sa">Dharmakāya</i>. Some sources also include this "first Buddha" as a sixth Buddha along with the five.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>In Japanese Buddhism, the Five Tathagathas are the primary objects of realization and meditation in Shingon Buddhism, a school of Vajrayana Buddhism founded by Kūkai. In Chinese Buddhism, veneration of the five Buddhas has dispersed from Chinese Esoteric Buddhism into other Chinese Buddhist traditions like Chan Buddhism and Tiantai. They are regularly enshrined in many Chinese Buddhist temples, and regularly invoked in rituals such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land and the Yoga Flaming Mouth ceremony (瑜伽焰口法會), as well as in general prayers and chants.</p>
        <aside>
          <p>[The Five Buddha Families] are also sometimes called the <i lang="sa">Dhyani-buddhas</i>, which is a term first recorded in English by Brian Houghton Hodgson, a British resident in Nepal, in the early 19th century, and is unattested in any surviving traditional primary sources.</p>

        <h2>Elements of the Five Families</h2>
        <p>In the tantric Buddhist literature, each of the five Buddhas have extensive qualities and features, including different directions, colors, mudrā, symbol, aspects, klesha, element; consort and spiritual son, as well as different animal vehicles (elephant, lion, peacock, harpies or garuda, or dragon).</p>
        <p>The cardinal positions of <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i> and <i lang="sa">Vairocana</i> can change depending on specific teachings. In a classic schema, <i lang="sa">Vairocana</i> may be seen as embodying sovereignty as the lord of the mandala and thus is at the central place of the mandala. <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i> then may face east as the second Buddha, and embodies steadfastness. He may be seated in the <i lang="sa">Vajraparyanka</i> (also known as <i lang="sa">Bhūmisparśa</i>) pose, with the right hand on the right knee, palm turned inwardly, and middle finger touching the ground. <i lang="sa">Amitābha</i> (Japanese: Amida), embodies measureless light and faces west. A statue of <i lang="sa">Amitābha</i>, when seated, has a <i lang="sa">samadhi mudrā</i> with both palms face up, on top of each other, in his lap.</p>
        <p>When these Five Buddhas are represented in mandalas of distinct Buddhist traditions, they may not always have the same colour or be related to the same direction. As mentioned, <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i> and <i lang="sa">Vairocana</i> may be switched, as in the <i lang="sa">Guhyasamaja</i> system which has <i lang="sa">Aksobhya</i> in the center, and as in the <i lang="bo">Longchen Nyingtig</i> tradition where <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i> is also in the center.</p>
        <p>In other cases, different Buddhas may take the center place as well depending on the teaching cycle or tantra which is being depicted.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>When represented in a Vairocana mandala of the Vajradhatu, the Buddhas are arranged as follows:</p>

        <h2>Main aspects of the Five Families</h2>
        <p>There is an expansive number of associations with each element of the Five Buddhas mandala, so that the mandala becomes a cipher and mnemonic visual thinking instrument and concept map; a vehicle for understanding and decoding the whole of the Dharma.</p>
        <p>In numerous Vajrayana sources, each Buddha Family or Division has numerous symbols, secondary figures including bodhisattvas, protectors, etc., abilities, and aspects.</p>

        <p>Some of the main esoteric associations of each family include:</p>

        <h2>Five female Buddhas and the families</h2>
        <p>Each male Buddha is paired with a female Buddha, often called mothers, <i lang="sa">prajña</i>, <i lang="sa">vidya</i>, or consort. Together, each family also presides over their own pure land or buddhafield. Although all five families abide in pure lands, it appears that only <i lang="sa">Sukhavati</i> of <i lang="sa">Amitābha</i>, and to a much lesser extent <i lang="sa">Abhirati</i> of <i lang="sa">Akshobhya</i>, where great masters like <i lang="sa">Vimalakirti</i> and <i lang="sa">Milarepa</i> are said to dwell, were popularly venerated. Some temples include all five Buddhas in their mandalas and statuary.</p>
        <p>The Five <i lang="sa">Tathāgathas</i> are protected by five Wisdom Kings called <i lang="sa">Vidyārājas</i>, and in China and Japan they are frequently depicted together in the Mandala of the Two Realms. In the Shurangama Mantra revealed in the <i lang="sa">Śūraṅgama Sūtra</i>, an especially influential <i lang="sa">dharani</i> in the Chinese Chan tradition, the Five <i lang="sa">Tathāgathas</i> are mentioned as the hosts of the five divisions which control the vast armies of the five directions.</p>
        <p>In an early Indian Yoga Tantra of the Five Families, the five <i lang="sa">prajña</i> consorts or five mothers (Tib. ཡུམ་ལྔ་, Wyl. <i lang="bo">yum lnga</i>), the associated bodhisattvas and their pure lands that correspond to the Five Tathagatas are:</p>
        <table border="1" id="simple_with_header">
        <thead>
          <tr> <td>Buddha (Skt.)</td>	<td>Wisdom Consort (prajña)</td> <td>Bodhisattva</td> <td>Vidyārāja protector</td>	<td>Pure land and direction</td> </tr>
        </thead>
        <tr> <td>Vairocana</td>	<td>Ākāśadhātvīśvarī, also known as Vajradhātvisharī, Buddhaḍākinī or Sparśavajrī</td>	<td>Vajraparamita or Vajrasattva</td> <td>Acala</td>	<td>Akaniṣṭha-Ghanavyūha (Center)</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>Akṣobhya</td> <td>Locanā, also known as Buddhalocanā, Tathāgatalocanā</td>	<td>Vajrapani or Samantabhadra</td>	<td>Trailokyavijaya</td> <td>Abhirati (East)</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>Amitābha</td> <td>Paṇḍāravāsinī, also known as Sitavāsinī</td>	<td>Avalokiteśvara</td>	<td>Yamāntaka</td> <td>Sukhāvatī (West)</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>Ratnasaṃbhava</td>	<td>Māmakī</td>	<td>Mañjusri, Ratnapani</td> <td>Kuṇḍali</td> <td>Śrīmat (South)</td> </tr>
        <tr> <td>Amoghasiddhi</td> <td>Tara, Samayatārā</td> <td>Maitreya, or Viśvapāni</td> <td>Vajrayakṣa</td>	<td>Karmaprasiddhi or Prakuṭā [es] (North)</td> </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Other tantras and commentaries provide alternative families and listings of the male and female Buddha pairings. In some systems, like the Guhyasamāja Tantra, Akṣobhya appears at the center of the mandala, with Sparśavajrī as consort. Sometimes Tara may appear as associated with the Lotus family, since one tradition states that she was born of Avalokitesvara.</p>
      <p>Each female Buddha also has their own mantra.</p>

        <h2>The <q>Sixth</q> Buddha, the dharma-body</h2>
        <p>The Five Buddhas may also be seen as aspects of the <i lang="sa">Dharmakāya</i> or <q>dharma-body</q>, which reflect all apparent phenomena. The <cite>Vajrasekhara Sutra</cite> also mentions a sixth Buddha, Vajradhara, <q>a Buddha (or principle) seen as the source, in some sense, of the five Buddhas.</q> This idea later developed into a tantric idea of the Adi-Buddha, which generally came to be seen as the ground of all the Five Buddhas, as the <i lang="sa">Dharmakāya</i> itself, the ultimate reality which spontaneously manifests the Five Buddha families. Different Buddhist traditions understand and name their highest Buddha in various ways.</p>
        <p>In the Nyingma school, the highest Buddhas are known as <i lang="sa">Samantabhadra</i> and <i lang="sa">Samantabhadri</i>. In Shingon Buddhism, it is <i lang="sa">Mahavairocana</i>. In Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, they understand all Buddhas as manifestations of <i lang="sa">Amitābha</i>.</p>
