        <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p><dfn>Cybersecurity</dfn> is the practice of protecting systems, <a target="_blank" href="networking.html">networks</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="programming.html">programs</a> from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity covers many aspects of the modern digital landscape, such as security measures to deliver data protection, information security, application security, network security, cloud security, endpoint device security, and the protection of people—staff, clients, customers, and public users of IT services. Recent technological advancements have opened up new possibilities for cybersecurity, but unfortunately, adversaries have benefited from these advancements, as well.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>There are a wide array of professional positions within the cybersecurity field. These positions generally fall into the following categories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Application security</strong> describes security used by applications with the goal of preventing data or code within the app from being hijacked or stolen. These security systems are implemented during application development but are designed to protect the application after deployment.</li>
          <li><strong>Cloud security</strong> involves the technology and procedures that secure cloud computing environments against internal and external threats. These security systems are designed to prevent unauthorized access and keep data and applications in the cloud secure.</li>
          <li><strong>Infrastructure security</strong> describes the physical and cyber systems that are so critical to society that their incapacity would have a debilitating impact on our physical, economic, or public health and safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) security</strong> involves the security of any device connected to the internet and/or other connected devices. The IoT is a network of connected things and people, all of which share data about the way they are used and their environments. These devices include appliances, sensors, televisions, routers, printers, and countless other home network devices. Securing these devices is very important, and security is often considered one of the biggest barriers to widespread IoT adoption.</li>
          <li><strong>Network security</strong> is the protection of network infrastructure from unauthorized access, abuse, or theft. These security systems involve creating a secure infrastructure in which devices, applications, and users work together.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applied Computing</h2>
        <p>Applied computing is a multidisciplinary field that blends the theoretical and practical aspects of computing to solve day-to-day business and industry problems—integrating computing with other subjects such as <a target="_blank" href="networking.html">computer networks</a>, cybersecurity, electrical engineering technology, healthcare, information systems, data science, industrial automation, network administration, robotics, and more.</p>
        <section>
          <h3>What's The Difference Between Applied Computing and Computer Science?</h3>
          <p>Applied computing and computer science are separate disciplines, but there is considerable overlap between the two fields. Applied computing concentrates on real-world applications, such as, how to use skills in a business setting, how to manage technology projects, and how to communicate effectively with other professionals in the workplace. Applied computing professionals work as as software engineers, systems analysts, cybersecurity specialists, electrical engineers, video game designers, and many other professions.</p>
          <p>Computer science focuses more on the theoretical underpinnings of computing with knowledge of technical processes and theories, such as <a target="_blank" href="algorithms.html">algorithms</a>, <a target="_blank" href="ai.html">artificial intelligence</a>, and natural language processing. Computer scientists may also know advanced mathematics to help them understand these theories. Those in the computer science field often pursue advanced degrees, research or teaching positions in academia, or careers in business, industry, and government as research fellows, data scientists, cryptanalytic computer scientists, and more.</p>
