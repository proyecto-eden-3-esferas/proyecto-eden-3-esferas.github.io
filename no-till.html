        <p>No-Dig Gardening is about doing less work and getting improved results from happy soil. Yes, you can boost your soil&apos;s health while saving your back! By not tilling, you allow the beneficial organisms in your soil to thrive undisturbed. Mother Nature does not use a spade, so why not follow her example?</p>

      <h1>No-Till Gardening/Farming</h1>
      <p><dfn>No-till gardening</dfn>—also called no-dig gardening, layer gardening, and lasagna gardening—is a technique that requires no turning over of soil, making it a better place for your plants to grow.</p>

      <section id="why">
        <h2>Why No-Till?</h2>
        <p>Turning the soil brings up weed seeds, and disrupts the natural soil structure. In nature, air and water spaces in the soil are critical to growing healthy plants, and ensures that there is less erosion from winds and rain.</p>
        <p>The no-till method saves time and energy while preserving the overall soil structure. The soil is then able to better retain water and is resistant to erosion. Since there is no cultivation involved, there are fewer weeds because new seeds are not brought to the surface to germinate, and any that grow are easy to remove in the soft soil.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>By simply adding organic materials (compost), you build on the fertility of your soil to keep it rich in nutrients that make your vegetables strong and healthy, requiring no extra fertilizer. You&apos;ll find your garden is much more productive.</p>
        <p>If you have raised beds, you are essentially following a no-dig garden technique. Fill the bed with a 50:50 mix of topsoil and compost and you can plant right into the bed!</p>

        <h2>How to Create a No-Till Raised-Bed Vegetable Garden</h2>
        <p>Creating a new no-till vegetable garden is simple:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>First, mark out your growing areas. Make beds no more than four feet wide to avoid the need to step on the growing areas. (This helps to minimize soil compaction, which makes tilling even less necessary.)</li>
          <li>Clear the soil surface of any debris and rocks.</li>
          <li>Mow grass short or cut weeds to the ground.</li>
          <li>Add a layer at least 4 inches thick of well-rotted organic matter such as compost, or manure from a trusted supplier who can guarantee no herbicides have been used.</li>
          <li>Flatten and lay out cardboard boxes over the entire planned (or existing) bed area.  Lay down with generous overlaps as the base for paths. Cover with shredded bark or similar for a non-slip surface.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The cardboard will kill all grass and weeds underneath.  Spread 1 to to 2-inch layers of compost material over the cardboard until the pile is about 8 to 10 inches high. Optionally, you can continue adding layers to a height of 2 to 3 feet as the pile will shrink over time due to the slowly composting organic material. Leave the new bed for several months to a year, or until bed has compacted and composted into dark, rich soil.</p>
        <p>If the organic matter is still lumpy when it&apos;s time to plant, start vegetable seedlings off in plug trays or pots to transplant when they&apos;ve developed a sturdy root system.</p>
        <p>An optional extra stage is to top the compost with wood chips (or other organic matter such as hay), as popularized by organic gardener Paul Gautschi in his <cite>Back to Eden</cite> method. Add the wood chips about two inches deep, making sure not to mix it into the compost beneath. Then, simply push aside the wood chips to plant directly into the compost. This top layer helps slow down evaporation and gradually feeds the soil below, reducing the need for additional fertilizers.</p>
          <h3>Future Labor</h3>
          <p>At the beginning of each growing season, spread a 1- to 2-inch layer of mulch or dead leaves over the top of the bed. The mulch helps to prevent any remaining weeds from growing and keeps the soil cool and moist. After the harvest in the fall, pull out all of the plants from the season and spread them over the soil. They will add to the existing nutrients and help the next year&apos;s vegetables to grow.</p>
