      <h1>Reproductive Cloning</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>[...] In <dfn>reproductive cloning</dfn>, a nucleus is extracted from a cell of the individual to be cloned and is inserted into the enucleated cytoplasm of a host egg (an <dfn>enucleated egg</dfn> is an egg cell that has had its own nucleus removed). The process results in the generation of an offspring that is genetically identical to the donor individual.</p>
        <p>The first animal produced by means of this cloning technique with a nucleus from an adult donor cell (as opposed to a donor embryo) was a sheep named Dolly, born in 1996. Since then a number of other animals, including pigs, horses, and dogs, have been generated by reproductive cloning technology. Recombinant DNA technology, on the other hand...</p>

        <p>Recombinant DNA technology involves the insertion of one or more individual genes from an organism of one species into the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of another. Whole-genome replacement, involving the transplantation of one bacterial genome into the <q>cell body,</q> or <strong>cytoplasm,</strong> of another microorganism, has been reported, although this technology is still limited to basic scientific applications.</p>
