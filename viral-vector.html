      <h1>Viral Vectors</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>Viral vectors</dfn> are modified viruses designed to deliver genetic material into cells. This process can be performed inside an organism or in cell culture. Viral vectors have widespread applications in basic research, agriculture, and medicine.</p>
        <p>Viruses have evolved specialized molecular mechanisms to transport their genomes into infected hosts, a process termed <dfn>transduction</dfn>. This capability has been exploited for use as viral vectors, which may integrate their genetic cargo—the transgene—into the host genome, although non-integrative vectors are also commonly used. In addition to agriculture and laboratory research, viral vectors are widely applied in gene therapy: as of 2022, all approved gene therapies were viral vector-based. Further, compared to traditional vaccines, the intracellular antigen expression enabled by viral vector vaccines offers more robust immune activation.</p>
        <p>Many types of viruses have been developed into viral vector platforms, ranging from retroviruses to cytomegaloviruses. Different viral vector classes vary widely in strengths and limitations, suiting some to specific applications. For instance, relatively non-immunogenic and integrative vectors like lentiviral vectors are commonly employed for gene therapy. Chimeric viral vectors—such as hybrid vectors with qualities of both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses—have also been developed.</p>
