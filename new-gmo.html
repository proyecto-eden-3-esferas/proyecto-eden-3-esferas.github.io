      <h1>New GMOs</h1>
      <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite>https://www.nongmoproject.org/</cite>)</p>
      <p><dfn>New GMOs</dfn>, also known as <q>NGTs,</q> are made from emerging technologies such as gene editing. They have crucial differences when compared with traditional, transgenic GMOs, as we shall see below. However, new GMOs are still made using biotechnology.</p>
      <p>New GMO techniques involve altering an organism&apos;s genetic material by adding, removing or cutting DNA or interfering with gene expression. While new techniques have been heralded as precise tools with which to modify an organism&apos;s genome, significant uncertainties remain. Genes are incredibly complex, powerful and delicate things; unintended outcomes and off-target effects are common in biotechnology.</p>
