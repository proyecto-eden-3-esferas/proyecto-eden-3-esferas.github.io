      <h1>Cutoff Frequency in Electronics</h1>
      <p>In electronics, <dfn>cutoff frequency</dfn> or <dfn>corner frequency</dfn> is the frequency either above or below which the power output of a circuit, such as a line, amplifier, or electronic filter has fallen to a given proportion of the power in the passband. Most frequently this proportion is one half the passband power, also referred to as the 3 dB point since a fall of 3 dB corresponds approximately to half power. As a voltage ratio this is a fall to 2<sup>1/2</sup>   ≈   0.707  of the passband voltage.</p>
      <!-- <p>Other ratios besides the 3 dB point may also be relevant, for example see § Chebyshev filters below.</p> -->
      <p>Far from the cutoff frequency in the transition band, the rate of increase of attenuation (roll-off) with logarithm of frequency is asymptotic to a constant. For a first-order network, the roll-off is −20 dB per decade (approximately −6 dB per octave.)</p>
