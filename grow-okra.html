      <h1>How to Grow Okra</h1>

      <section id="intro">
      <p>Okra (US: /ˈoʊkrə/, UK: /ˈɒkrə/), <i lang="la">Abelmoschus esculentus</i>, known in some English-speaking countries as lady&apos;s fingers, also as  or bhindi (Pakistan) is a flowering plant in the mallow family native to East Africa. Cultivated in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions around the world for its edible green seed pods, okra is featured in the cuisines of many countries.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="description">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The species is a perennial, often cultivated as an annual in temperate climates, often growing to around 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall. As a member of the Malvaceae, it is related to such species as cotton, cocoa, and hibiscus. The leaves are 10–20 centimetres (4–8 in) long and broad, palmately lobed with 5–7 lobes. The flowers are 4–8 cm (1+5⁄8–3+1⁄8 in) in diameter, with five white to yellow petals, often with a red or purple spot at the base of each petal. The pollens are spherical and approximately 188 microns in diameter. The fruit is a capsule up to 18 cm (7 in) long with pentagonal cross-section, containing numerous seeds.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="cultivation">
        <h2>Cultivation</h2>
        <p><i lang="la">Abelmoschus esculentus</i> is cultivated throughout the tropical and warm temperate regions of the world for its fibrous fruits or pods containing round, white seeds. It needs plenty of heat and sun, it is actually among the most heat- and drought-tolerant vegetable species in the world. It will tolerate soils with heavy clay and intermittent moisture, but frost can damage the pods.</p>
        <p>There are several varieties of okra to choose from, with plants varying in size. The pods are usually green, but there are varieties with red, pink or white pods.</p>
        <p>In cultivation, the seeds are soaked overnight prior to planting to a depth of 1–2 cm (3⁄8–13⁄16 in). It prefers a soil temperature of at least 20 °C (68 °F) for germination, which occurs between six days (soaked seeds) and three weeks. As a tropical plant, it also requires a lot of sunlight, and it should also be cultivated in soil that has a pH between 5.8 and 7, ideally on the acidic side. Seedlings require ample water. The seed pods rapidly become fibrous and woody and, to be edible as a vegetable, must be harvested when immature, usually within a week after pollination. The first harvest will typically be ready about 2 months after planting, and it will be approximately 2–3 inches (51–76 mm) long.</p>
        <del>
          <p>In the U.S. much of the supply is grown in Florida, especially around Dade in southern Florida. Okra is grown throughout the state to some degree, so okra is available ten months of the year. Yields range from less than 18,000 pounds per acre (20,000 kg/ha) to over 30,000 pounds per acre (34,000 kg/ha). Wholesale prices can go as high as $18/bushel which is $0.60 per pound ($1.3/kg). The Regional IPM Centers provide integrated pest management plans for use in the state.</p>
        </del>
        <section id="pests">
          <h3>Pests</h3>
          <p>The most common disease afflicting the okra plant is verticillium wilt, often causing a yellowing and wilting of the leaves. Other diseases include powdery mildew in dry tropical regions, leaf spots, yellow mosaic and root-knot nematodes. Resistance to yellow mosaic virus in A. esculentus was transferred through a cross with Abelmoschus manihot and resulted in a new variety called Parbhani kranti.</p>
          <p>Look out for red spider mites and whitefly, and take action at the first sign – biological controls are available. To deter them, improve air circulation [in the greenhouse by opening doors and vents], and raise humidity by damping down (pouring water on) the floor.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Sowing indoors</h3>
          <p>Sow okra seeds in March or April – soak the seeds for two hours in warm water beforehand, then sow individually into small pots or modular trays.</p>
          <p>Place in a propagator or cover with a clear polythene bag and keep above 16°C (60°F). An airing cupboard is ideal for germination.</p>
          <p>Once seedlings appear, remove the covering and place in good light and keep warm, watering regularly. Transfer into gradually larger pots as they grow.</p>
          <p>Four or five plants should produce enough okra for most families.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Planting</h3>
          <p>Once young okra plants are 10–15cm (4–6in) tall, in late May or June, transfer them to their final growing position.</p>
          <p>To plant in a container, choose a pot that&apos;s at least 30cm (1ft) wide and deep, and fill with multi-purpose compost. Position one okra plant in the centre, at the same level it was previously growing, firm in and water well. You can also plant two per growing bag.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Pinching out shoot tips</h3>
          <p>Once okra plants are 60cm (2ft) tall, pinch out the shoot tips to encourage side-shoots to form, which should result in more pods.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Supporting plants</h3>
          <p>Okra plants can grow tall – 90–120cm/3–4ft, depending on the variety – so provide canes for support.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Harvesting</h3>
          <p>Okra plants produce pods from mid-summer until temperatures drop in autumn, often up to the first frost. Regular picking encourages more pods to form.</p>
          <p>Harvest the pods when tender and immature, about 5–10cm (2–4in) long. Handle them gently as the skin is easily marked. Large mature pods become tough and stringy.</p>
          <p>Okra plants are covered in short hairs that may irritate bare skin, so wear gloves and long sleeves when harvesting or touching them.</p>
          <p>The pods can be cooked straight away or frozen for later use.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="uses">
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>[...]</p>
        <p>The pods of the plant are mucilaginous, resulting in the characteristic "goo" or slime when the seed pods are cooked; the mucilage contains soluble fiber. One possible way to de-slime okra is to cook it with an acidic food, such as tomatoes, to minimize the mucilage. Pods are cooked, pickled, eaten raw, or included in salads. Okra may be used in developing countries to mitigate malnutrition and alleviate food insecurity.</p>
        <p>The calcium-rich pods are used in soups, stews and curries.</p>
        <h3>Leaves and seeds</h3>
        <p>Young okra leaves may be cooked similarly to the greens of beets or dandelions, or used in salads. Okra seeds may be roasted and ground to form a caffeine-free substitute for coffee.</p>
        <p>Greenish-yellow edible okra oil is pressed from okra seeds; it has a pleasant taste and odor, and is high in unsaturated fats such as oleic acid and linoleic acid. The oil content of some varieties of the seed is about 40%. At 794 kilograms per hectare (708 lb/acre), the yield was exceeded only by that of sunflower oil in one trial.</p>
        <h3>Industrial</h3>
        <p>Bast fibre from the stem of the plant has industrial uses such as the reinforcement of polymer composites. The mucilage produced by the okra plant can be used for the removal of turbidity from wastewater by virtue of its flocculant properties. Having composition similar to a thick polysaccharide film, okra mucilage is under development as a biodegradable food packaging, as of 2018. A 2009 study found okra oil suitable for use as a biofuel.</p>
