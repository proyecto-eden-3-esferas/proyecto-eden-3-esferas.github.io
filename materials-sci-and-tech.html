      <aside>The world needs engineers and scientists who understand materials, in order to make them stronger, lighter, safer, greener, and more cost-effective.</aside>

      <h1>Materials Science and Technology</h1>
      <p><dfn>Materials science and engineering</dfn> seeks to understand the fundamental physical origins of material behavior in order to optimize properties of existing materials through structure modification and processing, design and invent new and better materials, and understand why some materials unexpectedly fail.</p>
      <p>Materials engineers work with a variety of materials, including metals and alloys; ceramics and glasses; polymers; <a target="_blank" href="electronics.html">electronic</a>, magnetic, and optical materials; and composites. They also work with many other emerging materials and processes, such as nanomaterials like graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs); biomaterials like artificial tissue and surgical mesh; 3D printing materials; specialized sensors; and smart materials.</p>

        <h2>What is Materials Science and Engineering?</h2>
        <p>Materials scientists and engineers work at the forefront of technology, applying physics, chemistry, and biology to compose new products—many of which have the potential to reduce our environmental impact and greatly improve our quality of life.</p>
        <p>These professionals have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New materials that allow energy conversion for a cleaner environment</li>
          <li>Artificial skin for burn victims</li>
          <li>Nanotechnologies that make computers smaller, faster, and more economical</li>
          <li>Tough new composites that enable mountain bikers to climb higher and faster</li>
          <li>Microscopic silicon chips that rewire themselves to conform to users' needs</li>
          <li>Medical diagnostic equipment such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Materials engineers often work closely with engineers from the other disciplines and with chemists, physicists, and other physical scientists.</p>
