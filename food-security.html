      <h1>Food Security</h1>

      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>global food security</dfn>, the availability of and access to resources in sufficient quantities to achieve adequate nutrition for the world population. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in 2022 some 2.4 billion people—about 29.6 percent of the world population—experienced moderate to severe limitations in access to food. Such widespread food insecurity is linked to various factors, especially conflict, local and national economic decline, poorly performing agricultural markets, and increased rates of inequality and poverty.</p>

      <p><dfn>Food Security</dfn> is a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have all the necessary means to access sufficient food to meet their needs and maintain a healthy life.</p>
      <p>The Biggest Threats to Global Food Security are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Climate Change and Environmental Shocks,</li>
        <li>Population Increase and the Modern Food System, and</li>
        <li>Disruptions in the Food Chain</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Recent declines in food security</h2>
        <p>The Global Food Security Index reviews the affordability, availability, sustainability, and quality and safety of food annually in more than 100 countries. Countries with consistently high ratings of food security include Finland, France, and Sweden. In the early 2020s, after nearly a decade of mostly positive increases, food security ratings fell worldwide. Countries in Africa and Asia are disproportionately affected by food shortages, owing to high levels of poverty, harsh climatic conditions, inequality, high population growth, and weak national economies.</p>
        <p>Declines in global food security in the 2020s were attributed in particular to the economic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which began in 2020. Russia&apos;s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 worsened the global food crisis as well, by disrupting agricultural supplies and causing significant increases in the price of wheat, corn (maize), fuel, and fertilizer. Other threats to food security include world population growth, drought, and the volatility of inflation and food prices. By 2023 most of the world was experiencing significant increases in inflation and trade restrictions. Some countries attempted to regulate prices domestically to control inflation but in the process inadvertently worsened the global food market. Increases in natural disasters and extreme weather events and the effects of armed conflicts compounded food shortages.</p>

        <h2>Strategies to improve food security</h2>
        <p>Food security can be improved in part by focusing on <a target="_blank" href="sustainable-agriculture.html">sustainable agriculture</a>, which can help mitigate effects of climate change, because of its emphasis on <a target="_blank" href="biodiversity.plants.html">diversity</a> in agricultural planning. Sustainable food systems are better able to withstand fluctuations in climate and disruptions to the supply chain than traditional agricultural approaches can. The incorporation of <a target="_blank" href="permaculture.html">permaculture</a>, such as using trees as windbreaks or firebreaks and planting many different varieties of plant species, can also help safeguard yields.</p>
        <p>Other ways to increase global food security involve promoting food safety measures and reducing food waste and losses, especially post-harvest losses—about one-third of food produced globally is wasted after harvesting. Post-harvest loss is primarily a problem in developed countries, where many consumers are not interested in purchasing cosmetically imperfect produce.</p>
        <p>There also have been efforts to expand consumer interest in and access to less-conventional protein sources, such as insects. Cricket flour, for example, is considered a useful source of protein and has anti-inflammatory effects. Insects can be raised and harvested sustainably, with very little environmental impact.</p>
        <p>Additionally, supporting governmental policies that address the root causes of poverty and make food more affordable and accessible for vulnerable households can also reduce food insecurity. In about half of U.S. states, the value of food assistance funds is doubled when it is spent on produce at farmers markets and farm stands; such programs have the added benefit of supporting farmers&apos; incomes while helping to meet consumers&apos; nutritional needs.</p>
