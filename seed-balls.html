      <h1>Seed Balls</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Seed balls are a fun and easy <a target="_blank" href="guerrilla-gardening.html">guerrilla gardening</a> project. While the concept of using seed balls for planting is not entirely new, the idea has been embraced by many guerrilla gardeners.</p>
        <p>Seeds balls are simply a mixture of seeds, compost, and clay that is packed tightly into smalls balls and allowed to dry. Then, the portable balls can be thrown in the nearest abandoned lot or neglected urban space.</p>
        <p>Eventually, rainfall will re-hydrate the dried ball of clay, freeing the seeds and allowing them to germinate and grow. (Again, make sure to use native plants that will be able to thrive without your intervention!)</p>
        <p>I love using wildflowers for seed balls! Wildflowers are sure to make any space more attractive, and they will provide food and shelter for pollinators.<!-- I think this pollinator mix from High Mowing Seeds would be a fabulous choice for seed balls!--></p>
        <p>See below for my foolproof seed ball recipe. This is such a fun project to do with friends, and even makes a great party favor!</p>
        <p>Materials for Seed Balls:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 parts dry red clay</li>
          <li>3 parts dried out organic compost (I like Coast of Maine compost)</li>
          <li>1 part seeds of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How to Make Seed Balls</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix one part seeds with three parts compost.</li>
          <li>Add five parts dry red clay to the seed/compost mixture.</li>
          <li>Add a little water slowly to the mixture, until it becomes a dough-like consistency.</li>
          <li>Shape the <q>dough</q> into marble-sized balls.</li>
          <li>Let the seed balls dry out on a cookie sheet in a shaded place for a couple days.</li>
          <li>To distribute, throw about ten balls per square yard of a ground.</li>
        </ol>
