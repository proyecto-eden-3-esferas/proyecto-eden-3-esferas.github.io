      <h1>Block Diagrammes</h1>
      <p>A block diagram can help you understand how a system works, and can help you troubleshoot it when it malfunctions. Each block has a label that describes or names the circuit it represents, but it doesn&apos;t explain the workings of the circuit, nor does it depict the individual components. When you gain a general understanding of how a system operates by examining its block diagram, you can consult each of its circuit schematics for more details. Consider two examples.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You want to design an electronic device to perform a specific task. You can simplify the process by drawing a block diagram that shows all the circuits you&apos;ll need to complete the project. Then you can expand each block into a schematic. In the end, you&apos;ll have a complete schematic that replaces all the blocks and shows the whole device in detail.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can approach the task the other way around. Imagine that you have a complicated schematic, and you want to use it to troubleshoot a device. Because the schematic shows every single component, you might find it difficult to determine which part of the device has the problem. A block diagram can help you envision how each circuit works in conjunction with the others. Once you&apos;ve found the troublesome circuit with the aid of the block diagram, you can examine its schematic and do tests to isolate the faulty component.</li>
      </ul>
