      <h1>Angiosperms or Flowering Plants</h1>
      <p>Angiosperm are any of about 300,000 species of the flowering plants, the largest and most diverse group within the kingdom <i lang="la">Plantae</i>. Angiosperms represent approximately 80 percent of all the known green plants now living. The angiosperms are vascular seed plants in which the ovule (egg) is fertilized and develops into a seed in an enclosed hollow ovary. The ovary itself is usually enclosed in a flower, that part of the angiospermous plant that contains the male or female reproductive organs or both. <a target="_blank" href="types-of-fruits.html">Fruits</a> are derived from the maturing floral organs of the angiospermous plant and are therefore characteristic of angiosperms. By contrast, in gymnosperms (e.g., conifers and cycads), the other large group of vascular seed plants, the seeds do not develop enclosed within an ovary but are usually borne exposed on the surfaces of reproductive structures, such as cones.</p>
      <p>Unlike such nonvascular plants as the <a target="_blank" href="">bryophytes</a>, in which all cells in the plant body participate in every function necessary to support, nourish, and extend the plant body (e.g., nutrition, photosynthesis, and cell division), angiosperms have evolved specialized cells and tissues that carry out these functions and have further evolved specialized vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) that translocate the water and nutrients to all areas of the plant body. The specialization of the plant body, which has evolved as an adaptation to a principally terrestrial habitat, includes extensive root systems that anchor the plant and absorb water and minerals from the soil; a stem that supports the growing plant body; and leaves, which are the principal sites of photosynthesis for most angiospermous plants. Another significant evolutionary advancement over the nonvascular and the more primitive vascular plants is the presence of localized regions for plant growth, called <dfn>meristems</dfn> and <dfn>cambia</dfn>, which extend the length and width of the plant body, respectively. Except under certain conditions, these regions are the only areas in which mitotic cell division takes place in the plant body, although cell differentiation continues to occur over the life of the plant.</p>
      <p>The angiosperms dominate Earth&apos;s surface and vegetation in more environments, particularly terrestrial habitats, than any other group of plants. As a result, angiosperms are the most important ultimate source of food for birds and mammals, including humans. In addition, the flowering plants are the most economically important group of green plants, serving as a source of pharmaceuticals, fiber products, timber, ornamentals, and other commercial products.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Although the taxonomy of the angiosperms is still incompletely known, the latest classification system incorporates a large body of comparative data derived from studies of DNA sequences. It is known as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group IV (APG IV) botanical classification system. The angiosperms came to be considered a group at the division level (comparable to the phylum level in animal classification systems) called <i lang="la">Anthophyta</i>, though the APG system recognizes only informal groups above the level of order.</p>
      <!--
      Throughout this article the orders or families are given, usually parenthetically, following the vernacular or scientific name of a plant. Following taxonomic conventions, genera and species are italicized. The higher taxa are readily identified by their suffixes: families end in -aceae and orders in -ales.

The variety of forms found among angiosperms is greater than that of any other plant group. The size range alone is quite remarkable, from the smallest individual flowering plant, probably the watermeal (Wolffia; Araceae) at less than 2 mm (0.08 inch), to one of the tallest angiosperms, Australia’s mountain ash tree (Eucalyptus regnans; Myrtaceae) at about 100 meters (330 feet). Between these two extremes lie angiosperms of almost every size and shape. Examples of this variability include the succulent cacti (Cactaceae), the fragile orchids (Orchidaceae), the baobabs (Adansonia species; Malvaceae), vines, rosette plants such as the dandelion (Asteraceae), and carnivorous plants such as sundews (Drosera; Droseraceae) and the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula; Droseraceae). To understand this vast array of forms, it is necessary to consider the basic structural plan of the angiosperms.

The basic angiosperm form is woody or herbaceous. Woody forms (generally trees and shrubs) are rich in secondary tissues, while herbaceous forms (herbs) rarely have any. Annuals are herbs that complete their growing cycle (growth, flowering, and death) within the same season. Examples of annuals can be found among cultivated garden plants, such as beans (Phaseolus and other genera; Fabaceae), corn (maize, Zea mays; Poaceae), and squashes (Cucurbita; Cucurbitaceae), as well as among the wildflowers, such as some buttercups (Ranunculus; Ranunculaceae) and poppies (Papaver and other genera; Papaveraceae). Biennials are also herbs, but, unlike annuals, their growing cycle spans two years: the vegetative (nonreproductive) plant growth takes place from seed during the first year, and flowers and fruit develop during the second. The beet (Beta vulgaris; Amaranthaceae) and carrot (Daucus carota; Apiaceae) are well-known biennials.

A perennial grows for many years and often flowers annually. In temperate areas the aerial parts of a perennial die back to the ground at the end of each growing season and new shoots are produced the following season from such subterranean parts as bulbs, rhizomes, corms, tubers, and stolons.

Structure
eudicotyledonous plant
eudicotyledonous plantFigure 1: A typical eudicotyledonous plant.
The basic angiosperm body has three parts: roots, stems, and leaves. These primary organs constitute the vegetative (nonreproductive) plant body. Together, the stem and its attached leaves constitute the shoot. Collectively, the roots of an individual plant make up the root system and the shoots the shoot system.

Root systems
The roots anchor a plant, absorb water and minerals, and provide a storage area for food. The two basic types of root systems are a primary root system and an adventitious root system. The most common type, the primary system, consists of a taproot (primary root) that grows vertically downward (positive geotropism). From the taproot are produced smaller lateral roots (secondary roots) that grow horizontally or diagonally. These secondary roots further produce their own smaller lateral roots (tertiary roots). Thus, many orders of roots of descending size are produced from a single prominent root, the taproot. Most eudicotyledons produce taproots—for example, the dandelion (Taraxacum officinale).

In some cases, the taproot system is modified into a fibrous, or diffuse, system, in which the initial secondary roots soon equal or exceed the primary root in size. The result is several large, positively geotropic roots that produce higher-order roots, which may also grow to the same size. Thus, in fibrous root systems there is no well-defined single taproot. In general, fibrous root systems are shallower than taproot systems.

The second type of root system, the adventitious root system, differs from the primary variety in that the primary root is often short-lived and is replaced or supplemented by many roots that form from the stem. Most monocotyledons have adventitious roots; examples include orchids (Orchidaceae), bromeliads (Bromeliaceae), and many other epiphytic plants in the tropics. Grasses (Poaceae) and many other monocotyledons produce fibrous root systems with the development of adventitious roots.

Adventitious roots, when modified for aerial support, are called prop roots, as in corn or some figs (Ficus; Moraceae). In many tropical rainforest trees, large woody prop roots develop from adventitious roots on horizontal branches and provide additional anchorage and support. Many bulbous plants have contractile adventitious roots that pull the bulb deeper into the ground as it grows. Climbing plants often grip their supports with specialized adventitious roots. Some lateral roots of mangroves become specialized as pneumatophores in saline mud flats; pneumatophores are lateral roots that grow upward (negative geotropism) for varying distances and function as the site of oxygen intake for the submerged primary root system. The plants mentioned above are only a few examples of root diversity in angiosperms, a condition that is unparalleled in any other vascular plant group.

Many primary root and adventitious root systems have become modified for special functions, the most common being the formation of tuberous (fleshy) roots for food storage. For example, carrots and beets are tuberous roots that are modified from taproots, and cassava (manioc) is a tuberous root that is modified from an adventitious root. (Tubers, on the other hand, are modified, fleshy, underground stems and will be discussed below.)

Stems
flower parts
flower partsParts of a flower.
The stem is an aerial axis of the plant that bears leaves and flowers and conducts water and minerals from the roots and food from the site of synthesis to areas where it is to be used. The main stem of a plant is continuous with the root system through a transition region called the hypocotyl. In the developing embryo, the hypocotyl is the embryonic axis that bears the seedling leaves (cotyledons).

In a maturing stem, the area where a leaf attaches to the stem is called a node, and the region between successive nodes is called an internode. Stems bear leafy shoots (branches) at the nodes, which arise from buds (dormant shoots). Lateral branches develop either from axillary, or lateral, buds found in the angle between the leaf and the stem or from terminal buds at the end of the shoot. In temperate-climate plants these buds have extended periods of dormancy, whereas in tropical plants the period of dormancy is either very short or nonexistent.

The precise positional relationship of stem, leaf, and axillary bud is important to understanding the diversity of the shoot system in angiosperms. Understanding this relationship makes it possible to identify organs such as leaves that are so highly modified they no longer look like leaves, or stems that are so modified that they resemble leaves.

Branching in angiosperms may be dichotomous or axillary. In dichotomous branching, the branches form as a result of an equal division of a terminal bud (i.e., a bud formed at the apex of a stem) into two equal branches that are not derived from axillary buds, although axillary buds are present elsewhere on the plant body. The few examples of dichotomous branching among angiosperms are found only in some cacti, palms (Arecaceae), and bird-of-paradise plants (Strelitziaceae).

The two modes of axillary branching in angiosperms are monopodial and sympodial. Monopodial branching occurs when the terminal bud continues to grow as a central leader shoot and the lateral branches remain subordinate—e.g., beech trees (Fagus; Fagaceae). Sympodial branching occurs when the terminal bud ceases to grow (usually because a terminal flower has formed) and an axillary bud or buds become new leader shoots, called renewal shoots—e.g., the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia; Asparagaceae). Plants with monopodial growth are usually pyramidal in overall shape, while those with sympodial growth often resemble a candelabra.

By combining monopodial and sympodial branching in one plant, many different tree architectures have evolved. A simple example is found in dogwoods (Cornus; Cornaceae), where the main axis is monopodial and the lateral branches are sympodial.

Very different plant forms result from simply changing the lengths of the internodes. Extreme shortening of the internodes results in rosette plants, such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa; Asteraceae), in which the leaves develop but the internodes between them do not elongate until the plant “bolts” when flowering. Extreme lengthening of the internodes often results in twining vines, as in the yam (Dioscorea esculenta; Dioscoreaceae).

Leaves
stipules
stipulesStipules of the tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera). Stipules develop at the base of a leaf and protect the developing blade.
The basic angiosperm leaf is composed of a leaf base, two stipules, a petiole, and a blade (lamina). The leaf base is the slightly expanded area where the leaf attaches to the stem. The paired stipules, when present, are located on each side of the leaf base and may resemble scales, spines, glands, or leaflike structures. The petiole is a stalk that connects the blade with the leaf base. The blade is the major photosynthetic surface of the plant and appears green and flattened in a plane perpendicular to the stem.

leaf morphology
leaf morphologyFigure 2: Common leaf morphologies.
When only a single blade is inserted directly on the petiole, the leaf is called simple. Simple leaves may be variously lobed along their margins. The margins of simple leaves may be entire and smooth or they may be lobed in various ways. The coarse teeth of dentate margins project at right angles, while those of serrate margins point toward the leaf apex. Crenulate margins have rounded teeth or scalloped margins. Leaf margins of simple leaves may be lobed in one of two patterns, pinnate or palmate. In pinnately lobed margins the leaf blade (lamina) is indented equally deep along each side of the midrib (as in the white oak, Quercus alba; Fagaceae), and in palmately lobed margins the lamina is indented along several major veins (as in the red maple, Acer rubrum; Sapindaceae). A great variety of base and apex shapes also are found.

simple and compound leaves
simple and compound leavesThe willow leaf (left) is simple. The walnut leaf (middle) is pinnately compound, or feather-shaped. The horse chestnut leaf (right) is palmately compound, or hand-shaped.
Many leaves contain only some of these leaf parts; for example, many leaves lack a petiole and so are attached directly to the stem (sessile), and others lack stipules (exstipulate). In compound leaves, a blade has two or more subunits called leaflets: in palmately compound leaves, the leaflets radiate from a single point at the distal end of the petiole; in pinnately compound leaves, a row of leaflets forms on either side of an extension of the petiole called the rachis. Some pinnately compound leaves branch again, developing a second set of pinnately compound leaflets (bipinnately compound). The many degrees of compoundness in highly elaborated leaves, such as bipinnately or tripinnately compound, cause these leaves to often appear to be shoot systems. It is always possible to distinguish them, however, because axillary buds are found in the angle between the stem and the petiole (axil) of pinnately or palmately compound leaves but not in the axils of leaflets.

Sweet woodruff

Sweet woodruffThe whorled leaves of sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum).
The three patterns of leaf arrangement on stems in angiosperms are alternate, opposite (paired), and whorled. In alternate-leaved plants, the leaves are single at each node and borne along the stem alternately in an ascending spiral. In opposite-leaved plants, the leaves are paired at a node and borne opposite to each other. A plant has whorled leaves when there are three or more equally spaced leaves at a node.

Leaf modifications
Whole leaves or parts of leaves are often modified for special functions, such as for climbing and substrate attachment, storage, protection against predation or climatic conditions, or trapping and digesting insect prey. In temperate trees, leaves are simply protective bud scales; in the spring when shoot growth is resumed, they often exhibit a complete growth series from bud scales to fully developed leaves.

Euphorbia
EuphorbiaEuphorbia fianarantsoae.
Stipules often develop before the rest of the leaf; they protect the young blade and then are often shed when the leaf matures. Spines are also modified leaves. In cacti, spines are wholly transformed leaves that protect the plant from herbivores, radiate heat from the stem during the day, and collect and drip condensed water vapor during the cooler night. In the many species of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), the stipules are modified into paired stipular spines and the blade develops fully. In ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens; Fouquieriaceae), the blade falls off and the petiole remains as a spine.

water hyacinth

Many desert plants, such as stoneplants (Lithops; Aizoaceae) and aloe (Aloe; Asphodelaceae), develop succulent leaves for water storage. The most common form of storage leaves are the succulent leaf bases of underground bulbs (e.g., tulip and Crocus) that serve as either water- or food-storage organs or both. Many nonparasitic plants that grow on the surfaces of other plants (epiphytes), such as some of the bromeliads, absorb water through specialized hairs on the surfaces of their leaves. In the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), swollen petioles keep the plant afloat.

tendrils
tendrilsTendrils of catbrier (Smilax rotundifolia). The stipules elongate and coil around other plants for support.
Leaves or leaf parts may be modified to provide support. Tendrils and hooks are the most common of these modifications. In the flame lily (Gloriosa superba; Colchicaceae), the leaf tip of the blade elongates into a tendril and twines around other plants for support. In the garden pea (Pisum sativum; Fabaceae), the terminal leaflet of the compound leaf develops as a tendril. In nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus; Tropaeolaceae) and Clematis (Ranunculaceae), the petioles coil around other plants for support. In catbrier (Smilax; Smilacaceae), the stipules function as tendrils. In certain vining angiosperms with compound leaves, some of the leaflets have modified into grapnel-like hooks—e.g., Tecoma radicans. Many monocotyledons have sheathing leaf bases that are concentrically arranged and form a pseudotrunk, as in banana (Musa). In many epiphytic bromeliads, the pseudotrunk also functions as a water reservoir.

Slender pitcher plant
Slender pitcher plantPitcher-shaped leaves of the carnivorous slender pitcher plant (Nepenthes gracilis).
Carnivorous plants use their leaves to attract and trap insects. Glands in the leaves secrete enzymes that digest the captured insects, and the leaves then absorb the nitrogenous compounds (amino acids) and other products of digestion. Plants that use insects as a nitrogen source tend to grow in nitrogen-deficient soils.
