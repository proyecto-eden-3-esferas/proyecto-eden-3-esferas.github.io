      <h1>Open Source Apache CouchDB: Another JSON Document DBMS</h1>
      <p>Apache CouchDB is an open-source document-oriented NoSQL database.</p>
      <p>CouchDB is implemented in Erlang.</p>
      <p>CouchDB uses multiple formats and protocols to store, transfer, and process its data. It uses <a target="_blank" href="json.html">JSON</a> to store data, <a target="_blank" href="js.html">JavaScript</a> as its query language using MapReduce, and HTTP for an API.</p>
      <p>CouchDB was first released in 2005 and later became an Apache Software Foundation project in 2008.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Each CouchDB database is a collection of independent documents. An application may access multiple databases, such as one stored on a user&apos;s mobile phone and another on a server. Document metadata contains revision information, making it possible to merge any differences that may have occurred while the databases were disconnected.</p>
      <p>CouchDB features document-level ACID semantics with eventual consistency</p>


      <section id="features">
        <h2>Main Features</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>ACID Semantics</dt>
          <dd>CouchDB provides ACID semantics. It does this by implementing a form of Multi-Version Concurrency Control, meaning that CouchDB can handle a high volume of concurrent readers and writers without conflict.</dd>
          <dt>Built for Offline</dt>
          <dd>CouchDB can replicate to devices (like smartphones) that can go offline and handle data sync for you when the device is back online.</dd>
          <dt>Distributed Architecture with Replication</dt>
          <dd>CouchDB was designed with bi-directional replication (or synchronization) and off-line operation in mind. That means multiple replicas can have their own copies of the same data, modify it, and then sync those changes at a later time.</dd>
          <dt>Document Storage</dt>
          <dd>CouchDB stores data as "documents", as one or more field/value pairs expressed as JSON. Field values can be simple things like strings, numbers, or dates; but ordered lists and associative arrays can also be used. Every document in a CouchDB database has a unique id and there is no required document schema.</dd>
          <dt>Eventual Consistency</dt>
          <dd>CouchDB guarantees eventual consistency to be able to provide both availability and partition tolerance.</dd>
          <dt>Map/Reduce Views and Indexes</dt>
          <dd>The stored data is structured using views. In CouchDB, each view is constructed by a JavaScript function that acts as the Map half of a map/reduce operation. The function takes a document and transforms it into a single value that it returns. CouchDB can index views and keep those indexes updated as documents are added, removed, or updated.</dd>
          <dt>HTTP API</dt>
          <dd>All items have a unique URI that gets exposed via HTTP. It uses the HTTP methods POST, GET, PUT and DELETE for the four basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on all resources.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>CouchDB also offers a built-in administration interface accessible via Web called Fauxton.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Special Features</h2>
        <p>CouchDB implements a form of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) so it does not lock the database file during writes. Conflicts are left to the application to resolve. Resolving a conflict generally involves first merging data into one of the documents, then deleting the stale one.</p>
        <p>Other features include (incremental) MapReduce, and (incremental) replication. One of CouchDB&apos;s distinguishing features is multi-master replication, which allows it to scale across machines to build high-performance systems. A built-in Web application called Fauxton (formerly Futon) helps with administration.</p>
