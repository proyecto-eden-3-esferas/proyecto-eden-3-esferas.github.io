      <h1>Vajra: Sacred Thunderbolt/Diamond Weapon</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>vajra</dfn>, five-pronged ritual object extensively employed in Tibetan Buddhist ceremonies. It is the symbol of the <a target="_blank" href="vajrayana.html">Vajrayāna</a> school of Buddhism.</p>
        <p><i lang="sa">Vajra</i>, in Sanskrit, has both the meanings of <q>thunderbolt</q> and <q>diamond</q>. Like the thunderbolt, the vajra cleaves through ignorance. The thunderbolt was originally the symbol of the Hindu rain god <i lang="sa">Indra</i> (who became the Buddhist <i lang="sa">Śakra</i>) and was employed by the 8th-century Tantric (esoteric) master Padmasambhava to conquer the non-Buddhist deities of Tibet. Like the diamond, the vajra destroys but is itself indestructible and is thus likened to <i lang="sa">śūnya</i> (the all-inclusive void).</p>
        <aside>
          <p>The vajra is fashioned out of brass or bronze, the four prongs at each end curving around the central fifth to form a lotus-bud shape. A nine-pronged vajra is less commonly used.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>In ritual use the vajra is frequently employed in conjunction with the bell (Sanskrit <i lang="sa">ghaṇṭā</i>; Tibetan <i lang="bo">dril bu</i>), the various gestures (<i lang="sa">mudrās</i>), when correctly executed, having considerable metaphysical power. The vajra (symbolizing the male principle, fitness of action) is held in the right hand and the bell (symbolizing the female principle, intelligence) in the left hand, the interaction of the two ultimately leading to enlightenment.</p>
        <p>In art the vajra is an attribute of many divinities, such as the celestial Buddha Akṣobhya and his manifestation as a <i lang="sa">bodhisattva</i> (“Buddha-to-be”), <i lang="sa">Vajrapāṇi</i> (In Whose Hand Is the Vajra). The <i lang="sa">viśva-vajra</i> is a double vajra in the shape of a cross with four equal arms.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><dfn>Vajra</dfn>, or <a lang="bo">Dorje</a> (<a lang="bo">rdo-rje</a>) in the Tibetan language, is a popular symbol in many Buddhist depictions and scriptures. The Vajra is a symbol of indestructibility, strength, and clarity of mind. It represents the unyielding, thunderbolt-like nature of enlightenment and the ability to cut through ignorance and delusion. The Vajra/Dorje is often used in ritual ceremonies and is considered a powerful tool for invoking spiritual power and protection.</p>
        <p>The symbol of Vajra is deemed the symbol of the impenetrable, immovable, and indestructible state of enlightenment. This is the general meaning of Vajra.</p>
        <p>That said, the meaning of the Vajra Symbol is not limited to this. So, what is the meaning of Vajra? Let&apos;s talk about it.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>The Vajra represents <strong>male</strong>, which symbolizes <i lang="sa">Upaya</i> or skillful means.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>In many depictions, Vajra is also depicted with the bell, which is the <strong>female</strong> counterpart of the Vajra, symbolizing the <i lang="sa">Prajna</i> or wisdom. In addition, some Hindu gods are depicted holding Vajra and Bell, which is considered the symbolic gesture of oneness of compassion and wisdom.</p>

        <h2><i lang="bo">Phur-Bu</i> (Ritual Dagger)</h2>
        <p><dfn>phur-bu</dfn>, (Tibetan: <q>peg</q>, or <q>nail</q>), a ritual dagger used in the Tantric (esoteric) rites of Tibetan Buddhism to exorcise evil. The dagger has a three-sided blade and a hilt that terminates in the head of <i lang="sa">Hayagrīva</i> (Tibetan: <i lang="bo">Rta-mgrin</i>), the fierce protective deity identified by a horse&apos;s head in the headdress. Other symbols characteristically used to ornament the phur-bu are the knots of immortality, head of a <i lang="sa">makara</i> (crocodile-like creature), and entwined serpents.</p>
