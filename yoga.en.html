        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>Yoga is one of the six systems (<dfn>darshans</dfn>) of Indian philosophy. Its influence has been widespread among many other schools of Indian thought. Its basic text is the Yoga-sutras by Patanjali (c. 2nd century bce or 5th century ce).</p>
        <p>The practical aspects of Yoga play a more important part than does its intellectual content, which is largely based on the philosophy of <strong>Samkhya</strong>, with the exception that Yoga assumes the existence of God, who is the model for the aspirant who seeks spiritual release. Yoga holds with Samkhya that the achievement of spiritual liberation (<i>moksha</i>) occurs when the spirit (<i>purusha</i>) is freed from the bondage of matter (<i>prakriti</i>) that has resulted from ignorance and illusion. The Samkhya view of the evolution of the world through identifiable stages leads Yoga to attempt to reverse this order, as it were, so that a person can increasingly dephenomenalize the self until it reenters its original state of purity and consciousness. An aspirant who has learned to control and suppress the obscuring activities of the mind and has succeeded in ending attachment to material objects will be able to enter <dfn>samadhi</dfn>—i.e., a state of deep concentration that results in a blissful ecstatic union with the ultimate reality.</p>

      <section id="stages">
        <h2>Yogic Stages</h2>
        <p>Generally, the Yoga process is described in eight stages (<i>ashtanga-yoga</i>, <q>eight-membered Yoga</q>). The first two stages are ethical preparations. They are <i>yama</i> (<q>restraint</q>), which denotes abstinence from injury<!-- (see ahimsa)-->, falsehood, stealing, lust, and avarice; and <i>niyama</i> (<q>discipline</q>), which denotes cleanliness of body, contentment, austerity, study, and devotion to God.</p>
        <p>The next two stages are physical preparations. <i>Asana</i> (<q>seat</q>), a series of exercises in physical posture, is intended to condition the aspirant&apos;s body and make it supple, flexible, and healthy. Mastery of the asanas is reckoned by one&apos;s ability to hold one of the prescribed postures for an extended period of time without involuntary movement or physical distractions. <i>Pranayama</i> (<q>breath control</q>) is a series of exercises intended to stabilize the rhythm of breathing in order to encourage complete respiratory relaxation.</p>
        <p>The fifth stage, <i>pratyahara</i> (<q>withdrawal of the senses</q>), involves control of the senses, or the ability to withdraw the attention of the senses from outward objects.</p>
        <p>Whereas the first five stages are external aids to Yoga, the remaining three are purely mental or internal aids. <i>Dharana</i> (<q>holding on</q>) is the ability to hold and confine awareness of externals to one object for a long period of time (a common exercise is fixing the mind on an object of meditation, such as the tip of the nose or an image of the deity). <i>Dhyana</i> (<q>concentrated meditation</q>) is the uninterrupted contemplation of the object of meditation, beyond any memory of ego. <i>Samadhi</i> (<q>total self-collectedness</q>) is the final stage and is a precondition of attaining release from <i>samsara</i>, or the cycle of rebirth. In this stage the meditator perceives or experiences the object of his meditation and himself as one.</p>

        <h2>The Practice of Yoga</h2>
        <p style="text-align: right">(From <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Types-of-Yoga">https://www.britannica.com/topic/Types-of-Yoga</a></cite>)</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Yoga is the ancient Indian philosophy of uniting the mind and body for the goal of spiritual release. What exactly does that have to do with the endless classes, not to mention the clothes, that have dominated the West&apos;s obsession with yoga for the past half century?</p>
          <p>There are some people who think of yoga as chanting while sitting like a kindergartner; others see yoga as the practice of twisting your body into impossible positions. For many who practice yoga, the mindful concentration on breathing paired with the physical focus on stretching, bending, and holding poses creates a unity of thought and movement that is akin to a runner&apos;s high. (<q>Yoga</q> comes from the Sanskrit word <i>yu</i>j, meaning <q>to unite.</q>)</p>
          <p>The benefits of yoga are becoming increasingly well documented. Studies done by the <cite>National Institute of Health</cite> have found that yoga can help with balance and flexibility as well as easing psychological distress. The research also found that because yoga requires minimal equipment, it is accessible to many people. Those are perhaps some of the reasons for yoga&apos;s growing popularity. According to the <cite>Center for Disease Control and Prevention</cite> data, the percentage of Americans who practice yoga grew from 5 percent in 2002 to 16 percent in 2022.</p>
          <p>Yet the varying types, the vocabulary (down dog, pigeon, sun salutations), and, yes, the clothes, can be barriers to entry. So here is an introductory look at several types of yoga, ordered roughly from the most basic to the most challenging, although such judgments are subjective. As for the clothes, be comfortable. A good yoga session is one in which you—even in a full studio—focus on your breath and your movements and not on what you or anyone else is wearing.</p>

        <h2>Types of Yoga Poses</h2>
        <p>There are hundreds of yoga poses, but here are fundamental movements to bring you into your practice:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standing yoga poses</strong>: Standing poses are often done first in a yoga class to <q>build heat</q> as a warmup. In vinyasa flow, standing yoga poses are performed sequentially to form sequences. Hatha classes typically have yogis do standing poses with rest between.</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing yoga poses</strong>: Beginners&apos; balances are an important way to build core strength for advanced yoga poses. Though balances may seem challenging initially, they will improve with regular practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Backbends</strong>: Beginners generally start with gentle spine flexion (bending forward) and extension (bending backward), eventually moving to deeper bends. Since daily life rarely requires you to move like this, backbends are essential for spinal health and longevity.</li>
          <li><strong>Seated yoga poses</strong>: Seated stretches, focusing on hip and hamstring mobility, are usually done near the end of a yoga class after your body is warm. Placing a folded yoga blanket or block under your butt is an excellent way to make yourself more comfortable.</li>
          <li><strong>Resting or supine yoga poses</strong>: It&apos;s essential to get to know your resting yoga poses, especially child&apos;s pose, which you are encouraged to do whenever you need a break. These resting yoga poses continue hip and hamstring work and provide gentle back-bending, twisting, and inversion.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
          <p>Hatha yoga focuses on posture and breathing techniques to channel vital energy sources. In Sanskrit, Hatha translates to force. The practice involves breath, body, and mind, and classes are usually 45 minutes to 90 minutes and include breathing, yoga poses, and meditation.</p>
          <del>
          <p>Hatha yoga breathing techniques can be traced back to the 1st Century in both Buddhist and Hindu texts. It was another 1,000 years before the use of yoga postures, or asanas, and breath control was recorded to enhance vital energy.</p>

          <h3>Vinyasa Flow</h3>
          <p>This popular style, also called vinyasa flow, links movement and breath.</p>
          <p><dfn>Vinyasa</dfn> yoga, also called <q>flow</q> because of the smooth way the poses run together, is one of the most popular contemporary styles of yoga. It&apos;s a broad classification that encompasses many different types of yoga, including <a target="#ashtanga">Ashtanga</a> and power yoga. Here is what you need to know about vinyasa yoga.</p>
          <p>Vinyasa stands in opposition to hatha. Hatha classes focus on one pose at a time, with rest in between. In contrast, flow classes string poses together to make a sequence. Due to vinyasa&apos;s more active nature, you should ideally be wearing clothes that move with you in lightweight, sweat-wicking material. A sports bra for yoga will also provide the right amount of support to carry you through flow of your poses.</p>
          <p>The sequence may be fixed, as in Ashtanga, in which the poses are always done in the same order. But most of the time, vinyasa teachers have the discretion to arrange the progression of poses in their own ways.</p>
          <p>In vinyasa yoga, each movement is synchronized with a breath. The breath is given primacy, acting as an anchor as you move from one pose to the next.</p>
          <p>A cat-cow stretch is an example of a very simple vinyasa. The spine is arched on an inhale and rounded on an exhale. A sun salutation sequence is a more complex vinyasa. Each movement in the series is cued by an inhalation or an exhalation of the breath.</p>
          <p>Some popular yoga styles fall under the vinyasa umbrella, including Jivamukti, CorePower, Baptiste Power Vinyasa, and Modo. If a class is identified as vinyasa yoga, it may use aspects of several different traditions.</p>

          <h3>Standing</h3>
          <section>
            <h4>Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose)</h4>
            <p>Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose) provides a powerful opportunity to build concentration and awareness. This twist requires you to stay in the moment, which is a valuable antidote for a wandering mind. And by giving yourself over to the more physically difficult elements of the posture, you can improve your practice of ekagrata, or one-pointed focus. Parivrtta Trikonasana is a strong counter-pose to Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose), and serves to improve balance, and build stability, among many other benefits.</p>
            <p>In Revolved Triangle, it&apos;s extremely important not to over-twist the neck, and instead focus on the muscles in the middle and upper back. <q>The tendency for most of us is to twist where it&apos;s easy and avoid twisting where it&apos;s not,</q> explains Yoga Journal contributor Natasha Rizopoulos. <q>This usually means that you will overwork the neck, which is relatively mobile, and underwork the middle and upper back, the parts of the spine that in many people are about as malleable and responsive as a block of cement.</q></p>
            <p>When you overwork an area, you run the risk of making it vulnerable to injury. If you can keep integrity in the rest of your body rather than falling into the trap of over-twisting the neck, Parivrtta Trikonasana can help work a needed and undervalued area of the body: the thoracic spine. And, working the muscles in an area that you perhaps typically forget can create a valuable opportunity to enhance the presence of the mind in relation to the body.</p>
            <p>Sanskrit: Parivrtta Trikonasana</p>
            <p>Revolved Triangle Pose: Step-by-step instructions</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Begin in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) at the top of your mat.</li>
              <li>Step or lightly jump your feet 3 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms parallel to the floor and reach them actively to the sides, shoulder blades wide, palms down.</li>
              <li>Turn your left foot in slightly and your right foot out to 90 degrees. Align your right heel with your left heel. Firm your thighs and turn your right thigh outward, so the center of your right kneecap is in line with the center of the right ankle.</li>
              <li>Exhale and extend your torso to the right, directly over the plane of your right leg, bending from the hip joint, not the waist. Anchor this movement by strengthening your left leg and pressing your outer heel firmly to the floor. Rotate your torso to the left, keeping the left and right sides of your torso equally long. Let your left hip come slightly forward and lengthen your tailbone toward the back heel.</li>
              <li>Rest your right hand on your shin or ankle or the floor outside your right foot—whatever is possible without distorting the sides of your torso. Stretch your left arm toward the ceiling, in line with the tops of your shoulders. Keep your head in a neutral position or turn it to the left, eyes gazing softly at your left thumb.</li>
              <li>Stay in this pose for 30 to 60 seconds. Inhale to come up, strongly pressing your back heel into the floor and reaching your top arm toward the ceiling. Reverse your e feet and repeat for the same length of time on the other side.</li>
